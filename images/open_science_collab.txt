and predictors of reproducibility, but limited
evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and
insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct
replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a pre-

viously observed finding and is the means of
establishing reproducibility of a finding with
new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of
the reproducibility of psychological science.

CONCLUSION: No single indicator sufficientRESULTS: We conducted replications of 100

experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using highpowered designs and original materials when
available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated
reproducibility using significance and P values,
effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes.
The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original
effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a

ly describes replication success, and the five
indicators examined here are not the only
ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless,
collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced
weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original
authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect
the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational
evidence is consistent with the conclusion that
variation in the strength of initial evidence
(such as original P value) was more predictive
of replication success than variation in the
characteristics of the teams conducting the
research (such as experience and expertise).
The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do
so here.
Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists
prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for
a productive, effective scientific enterprise.
However, innovative ideas become old news
fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this”
belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence.
Innovation points out paths that are possible;
replication points out paths that are likely;
progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced
and promote innovation when they are not.
This project provides accumulating evidence
for many findings in psychological research
and suggests that there is still more work to
do to verify whether we know what we think
we know.

Estimating the reproducibility of

eproducibility is a core principle of scientific progress (1–6). Scientific claims should
not gain credence because of the status or
authority of their originator but by the
replicability of their supporting evidence.
Scientists attempt to transparently describe the
methodology and resulting evidence used to support their claims. Other scientists agree or disagree whether the evidence supports the claims,
citing theoretical or methodological reasons or
by collecting new evidence. Such debates are
meaningless, however, if the evidence being
debated is not reproducible.
Even research of exemplary quality may have
irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. Direct replication is
the attempt to recreate the conditions believed
sufficient for obtaining a previously observed
finding (7, 8) and is the means of establishing
reproducibility of a finding with new data. A
direct replication may not obtain the original
result for a variety of reasons: Known or unknown differences between the replication and
original study may moderate the size of an observed effect, the original result could have been
a false positive, or the replication could produce
a false negative. False positives and false negatives provide misleading information about effects,
and failure to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions to reproduce a finding indicates
an incomplete theoretical understanding. Direct
replication provides the opportunity to assess
and improve reproducibility.
There is plenty of concern (9–13) about the
rate and predictors of reproducibility but limited
evidence. In a theoretical analysis, Ioannidis estimated that publishing and analytic practices
make it likely that more than half of research

results are false and therefore irreproducible (9).
Some empirical evidence supports this analysis.
In cell biology, two industrial laboratories reported success replicating the original results of
landmark findings in only 11 and 25% of the
attempted cases, respectively (10, 11). These numbers are stunning but also difficult to interpret
because no details are available about the studies,
methodology, or results. With no transparency, the
reasons for low reproducibility cannot be evaluated.
Other investigations point to practices and
incentives that may inflate the likelihood of
obtaining false-positive results in particular or
irreproducible results more generally. Potentially problematic practices include selective
reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient
specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results (12–23). We were inspired to address the gap in direct empirical
evidence about reproducibility. In this Research
Article, we report a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
Method
Starting in November 2011, we constructed a
protocol for selecting and conducting highquality replications (24). Collaborators joined
the project, selected a study for replication from
the available studies in the sampling frame, and
were guided through the replication protocol.
The replication protocol articulated the process
of selecting the study and key effect from the
available articles, contacting the original authors
for study materials, preparing a study protocol
and analysis plan, obtaining review of the protocol by the original authors and other members
within the present project, registering the protocol publicly, conducting the replication, writing the final report, and auditing the process and
analysis for quality control. Project coordinators

Sampling frame and study selection
We constructed a sampling frame and selection
process to minimize selection biases and maximize generalizability of the accumulated evidence. Simultaneously, to maintain high quality,
within this sampling frame we matched individual replication projects with teams that had
relevant interests and expertise. We pursued a
quasi-random sample by defining the sampling
frame as 2008 articles of three important psychology journals: Psychological Science (PSCI),
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
(JPSP), and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition (JEP:
LMC). The first is a premier outlet for all psychological research; the second and third are
leading disciplinary-specific journals for social
psychology and cognitive psychology, respectively [more information is available in (24)].
These were selected a priori in order to (i) provide a tractable sampling frame that would not
plausibly bias reproducibility estimates, (ii) enable comparisons across journal types and subdisciplines, (iii) fit with the range of expertise
available in the initial collaborative team, (iv) be
recent enough to obtain original materials, (v) be
old enough to obtain meaningful indicators of citation impact, and (vi) represent psychology subdisciplines that have a high frequency of studies
that are feasible to conduct at relatively low cost.
The first replication teams could select from a
pool of the first 20 articles from each journal,
starting with the first article published in the
first 2008 issue. Project coordinators facilitated
matching articles with replication teams by interests and expertise until the remaining articles were difficult to match. If there were still
interested teams, then another 10 articles from
one or more of the three journals were made
available from the sampling frame. Further,
project coordinators actively recruited teams
from the community with relevant experience
for particular articles. This approach balanced
competing goals: minimizing selection bias by

Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes
current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational
studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original
materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects,
representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically
significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47%
of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of
effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original
results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically
significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by
the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.

facilitated each step of the process and maintained the protocol and project resources. Replication materials and data were required to be
archived publicly in order to maximize transparency, accountability, and reproducibility of the
project (https://osf.io/ezcuj).
In total, 100 replications were completed by
270 contributing authors. There were many different research designs and analysis strategies
in the original research. Through consultation
with original authors, obtaining original materials, and internal review, replications maintained
high fidelity to the original designs. Analyses converted results to a common effect size metric [correlation coefficient (r)] with confidence intervals
(CIs). The units of analysis for inferences about
reproducibility were the original and replication
study effect sizes. The resulting open data set
provides an initial estimate of the reproducibility
of psychology and correlational data to support
development of hypotheses about the causes of
reproducibility.

The most common reasons for failure to match
an article with a team were feasibility constraints
for conducting the research. Of the 47 articles
from the eligible pool that were not claimed, six
(13%) had been deemed infeasible to replicate
because of time, resources, instrumentation, dependence on historical events, or hard-to-access
samples. The remaining 41 (87%) were eligible
but not claimed. These often required specialized
samples (such as macaques or people with autism),
resources (such as eye tracking machines or functional magnetic resonance imaging), or knowledge making them difficult to match with teams.
Aggregate data preparation
Each replication team conducted the study, analyzed their data, wrote their summary report,
and completed a checklist of requirements for
sharing the materials and data. Then, independent reviewers and analysts conducted a projectwide audit of all individual projects, materials,
data, and reports. A description of this review is
available on the OSF (https://osf.io/xtine). Moreover, to maximize reproducibility and accuracy,
the analyses for every replication study were reproduced by another analyst independent of
the replication team using the R statistical programming language and a standardized analytic
format. A controller R script was created to regenerate the entire analysis of every study and
recreate the master data file. This R script, available at https://osf.io/fkmwg, can be executed to
reproduce the results of the individual studies. A
comprehensive description of this reanalysis process is available publicly (https://osf.io/a2eyg).
Measures and moderators
We assessed features of the original study and
replication as possible correlates of reproducibility and conducted exploratory analyses to
inspire further investigation. These included
characteristics of the original study such as the
publishing journal; original effect size, P value,
and sample size; experience and expertise of the
original research team; importance of the effect,
with indicators such as the citation impact of
the article; and rated surprisingness of the effect. We also assessed characteristics of the replication such as statistical power and sample size,
experience and expertise of the replication team,
independently assessed challenge of conducting
an effective replication, and self-assessed quality
of the replication effort. Variables such as the P
value indicate the statistical strength of evidence
given the null hypothesis, and variables such as
“effect surprisingness” and “expertise of the team”
indicate qualities of the topic of study and the
teams studying it, respectively. The master data file,
containing these and other variables, is available
for exploratory analysis (https://osf.io/5wup8).
It is possible to derive a variety of hypotheses
about predictors of reproducibility. To reduce the
likelihood of false positives due to many tests, we
aggregated some variables into summary indicators: experience and expertise of original team,
experience and expertise of replication team, challenge of replication, self-assessed quality of repli-

cation, and importance of the effect. We had no a
priori justification to give some indicators stronger weighting over others, so aggregates were
created by standardizing [mean (M) = 0, SD = 1]
the individual variables and then averaging to
create a single index. In addition to the publishing journal and subdiscipline, potential moderators included six characteristics of the original
study and five characteristics of the replication
(supplementary materials).
Publishing journal and subdiscipline
Journals’ different publishing practices may result in a selection bias that covaries with reproducibility. Articles from three journals were made
available for selection: JPSP (n = 59 articles), JEP:
LMC (n = 40 articles), and PSCI (n = 68 articles).
From this pool of available studies, replications
were selected and completed from JPSP (n = 32
studies), JEP:LMC (n = 28 studies), and PSCI
(n = 40 studies) and were coded as representing
cognitive (n = 43 studies) or social-personality
(n = 57 studies) subdisciplines. Four studies that
would ordinarily be understood as “developmental
psychology” because of studying children or infants
were coded as having a cognitive or social emphasis. Reproducibility may vary by subdiscipline
in psychology because of differing practices. For
example, within-subjects designs are more common in cognitive than social psychology, and
these designs often have greater power to detect
effects with the same number of participants.
Statistical analyses
There is no single standard for evaluating replication success (25). We evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes,
subjective assessments of replication teams, and
meta-analyses of effect sizes. All five of these
indicators contribute information about the relations between the replication and original finding and the cumulative evidence about the effect
and were positively correlated with one another
(r ranged from 0.22 to 0.96, median r = 0.57).
Results are summarized in Table 1, and full details
of analyses are in the supplementary materials.
Significance and P values
Assuming a two-tailed test and significance or
a level of 0.05, all test results of original and
replication studies were classified as statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) and nonsignificant
(P > 0.05). However, original studies that interpreted nonsignificant P values as significant
were coded as significant (four cases, all with
P values < 0.06). Using only the nonsignificant
P values of the replication studies and applying
Fisher’s method (26), we tested the hypothesis
that these studies had “no evidential value” (the
null hypothesis of zero-effect holds for all these
studies). We tested the hypothesis that the proportions of statistically significant results in the
original and replication studies are equal using
the McNemar test for paired nominal data and
calculated a CI of the reproducibility parameter. Second, we compared the central tendency
of the distribution of P values of original and

having only a small set of articles available at a
time and matching studies with replication
teams’ interests, resources, and expertise.
By default, the last experiment reported in
each article was the subject of replication. This
decision established an objective standard for
study selection within an article and was based
on the intuition that the first study in a multiplestudy article (the obvious alternative selection
strategy) was more frequently a preliminary
demonstration. Deviations from selecting the
last experiment were made occasionally on
the basis of feasibility or recommendations of
the original authors. Justifications for deviations
were reported in the replication reports, which
were made available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) (http://osf.io/ezcuj). In total, 84 of
the 100 completed replications (84%) were of
the last reported study in the article. On average, the to-be-replicated articles contained 2.99
studies (SD = 1.78) with the following distribution: 24 single study, 24 two studies, 18 three
studies, 13 four studies, 12 five studies, 9 six or
more studies. All following summary statistics
refer to the 100 completed replications.
For the purposes of aggregating results across
studies to estimate reproducibility, a key result
from the selected experiment was identified as
the focus of replication. The key result had to be
represented as a single statistical inference test
or an effect size. In most cases, that test was a
t test, F test, or correlation coefficient. This effect
was identified before data collection or analysis
and was presented to the original authors as part
of the design protocol for critique. Original authors occasionally suggested that a different
effect be used, and by default, replication teams
deferred to original authors’ judgments. Nonetheless, because the single effect came from a
single study, it is not necessarily the case that
the identified effect was central to the overall
aims of the article. In the individual replication
reports and subjective assessments of replication outcomes, more than a single result could
be examined, but only the result of the single
effect was considered in the aggregate analyses
[additional details of the general protocol and
individual study methods are provided in the
supplementary materials and (25)].
In total, there were 488 articles in the 2008
issues of the three journals. One hundred fiftyeight of these (32%) became eligible for selection for replication during the project period,
between November 2011 and December 2014.
From those, 111 articles (70%) were selected by a
replication team, producing 113 replications. Two
articles had two replications each (supplementary
materials). And 100 of those (88%) replications
were completed by the project deadline for inclusion in this aggregate report. After being
claimed, some studies were not completed because the replication teams ran out of time or
could not devote sufficient resources to completing the study. By journal, replications were
completed for 39 of 64 (61%) articles from
PSCI, 31 of 55 (56%) articles from JPSP, and 28
of 39 (72%) articles from JEP:LMC.

replication studies using the Wilcoxon signedrank test and the t test for dependent samples.
For both tests, we only used study-pairs for which
both P values were available.
Effect sizes
We transformed effect sizes into correlation coefficients whenever possible. Correlation coefficients have several advantages over other effect
size measures, such as Cohen’s d. Correlation
coefficients are bounded, well known, and therefore more readily interpretable. Most important for our purposes, analysis of correlation
coefficients is straightforward because, after apSCIENCE sciencemag.org

plying the Fisher transformation, their standard
error is only a function of sample size. Formulas
and code for converting test statistics z, F, t, and
c2 into correlation coefficients are provided in
the appendices at http://osf.io/ezum7. To be able
to compare and analyze correlations across studypairs, the original study’s effect size was coded
as positive; the replication study’s effect size was
coded as negative if the replication study’s effect
was opposite to that of the original study.
We compared effect sizes using four tests. We
compared the central tendency of the effect size
distributions of original and replication studies
using both a paired two-sample t test and the

Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Third, we computed
the proportion of study-pairs in which the effect
of the original study was stronger than in the
replication study and tested the hypothesis that
this proportion is 0.5. For this test, we included
findings for which effect size measures were
available but no correlation coefficient could be
computed (for example, if a regression coefficient
was reported but not its test statistic). Fourth,
we calculated “coverage,” or the proportion of
study-pairs in which the effect of the original
study was in the CI of the effect of the replication
study, and compared this with the expected proportion using a goodness-of-fit c2 test. We carried

Meta-analysis combining original and
replication effects

Subjective assessment of “Did it replicate?”
In addition to the quantitative assessments of
replication and effect estimation, we collected
subjective assessments of whether the replication provided evidence of replicating the original result. In some cases, the quantitative data
anticipate a straightforward subjective assessment of replication. For more complex designs,
such as multivariate interaction effects, the quantitative analysis may not provide a simple interpretation. For subjective assessment, replication
teams answered “yes” or “no” to the question,
“Did your results replicate the original effect?”
Additional subjective variables are available for

Evaluating replication effect against
original effect size
A complementary method for evaluating replication is to test whether the original effect size is
within the 95% CI of the effect size estimate from
the replication. For the subset of 73 studies in
which the standard error of the correlation could
be computed, 30 (41.1%) of the replication CIs
contained the original effect size (significantly
lower than the expected value of 78.5%, P <
0.001) (supplementary materials). For 22 studies
using other test statistics [F(df1 > 1, df2) and c2],
68.2% of CIs contained the effect size of the
original study. Overall, this analysis suggests a
47.4% replication success rate.
This method addresses the weakness of the
first test that a replication in the same direction
and a P value of 0.06 may not be significantly
different from the original result. However, the
method will also indicate that a replication “fails”
when the direction of the effect is the same but
the replication effect size is significantly smaller
than the original effect size (29). Also, the replication “succeeds” when the result is near zero but
not estimated with sufficiently high precision to
be distinguished from the original effect size.
Comparing original and replication
effect sizes
Comparing the magnitude of the original and
replication effect sizes avoids special emphasis
on P values. Overall, original study effect sizes

A straightforward method for evaluating replication is to test whether the replication shows a
statistically significant effect (P < 0.05) with the
same direction as the original study. This dichotomous vote-counting method is intuitively
appealing and consistent with common heuristics used to decide whether original studies
“worked.” Ninety-seven of 100 (97%) effects
from original studies were positive results (four
had P values falling a bit short of the 0.05
criterion—P = 0.0508, 0.0514, 0.0516, and 0.0567—
but all of these were interpreted as positive
effects). On the basis of only the average replication power of the 97 original, significant effects [M = 0.92, median (Mdn) = 0.95], we would
expect approximately 89 positive results in the
replications if all original effects were true and
accurately estimated; however, there were just
35 [36.1%; 95% CI = (26.6%, 46.2%)], a significant
reduction [McNemar test, c2(1) = 59.1, P < 0.001].
A key weakness of this method is that it treats
the 0.05 threshold as a bright-line criterion between replication success and failure (28). It
could be that many of the replications fell just
short of the 0.05 criterion. The density plots of
P values for original studies (mean P value =
0.028) and replications (mean P value = 0.302)
are shown in Fig. 1, left. The 64 nonsignificant

We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses using
the R package metafor (27) on Fisher-transformed
correlations for all study-pairs in subset MA and
on study-pairs with the odds ratio as the dependent variable. The number of times the CI of all
these meta-analyses contained 0 was calculated.
For studies in the MA subset, estimated effect
sizes were averaged and analyzed by discipline.

P values for replications were distributed widely.
When there is no effect to detect, the null distribution of P values is uniform. This distribution deviated slightly from uniform with positive skew,
however, suggesting that at least one replication
could be a false negative, c2(128) = 155.83, P =
0.048. Nonetheless, the wide distribution of P
values suggests against insufficient power as the
only explanation for failures to replicate. A scatterplot of original compared with replication
study P values is shown in Fig. 2.

provided a subjective assessment of replication
success of the study they conducted. Subjective
assessments of replication success were very similar to significance testing results (39 of 100 successful replications), including evaluating “success”
for two null replications when the original study
reported a null result and “failure” for a P < 0.05
replication when the original result was a null.
Correlates of reproducibility

(M = 0.403, SD = 0.188) were reliably larger than
replication effect sizes (M = 0.197, SD = 0.257),
Wilcoxon’s W = 7137, P < 0.001. Of the 99 studies
for which an effect size in both the original and
replication study could be calculated (30), 82
showed a stronger effect size in the original
study (82.8%; P < 0.001, binomial test) (Fig. 1,
right). Original and replication effect sizes were
positively correlated (Spearman’s r = 0.51, P <
0.001). A scatterplot of the original and replication effect sizes is presented in Fig. 3.
Combining original and replication effect
sizes for cumulative evidence
The disadvantage of the descriptive comparison
of effect sizes is that it does not provide information
about the precision of either estimate or resolution
of the cumulative evidence for the effect. This is
often addressed by computing a meta-analytic estimate of the effect sizes by combining the original
and replication studies (28). This approach weights
each study by the inverse of its variance and uses
these weighted estimates of effect size to estimate
cumulative evidence and precision of the effect.
Using a fixed-effect model, 51 of the 75 (68%) effects for which a meta-analytic estimate could be
computed had 95% CIs that did not include 0.
SCIENCE sciencemag.org

One qualification about this result is the possibility that the original studies have inflated
effect sizes due to publication, selection, reporting, or other biases (9, 12–23). In a discipline with
low-powered research designs and an emphasis
on positive results for publication, effect sizes
will be systematically overestimated in the published literature. There is no publication bias in
the replication studies because all results are
reported. Also, there are no selection or reporting
biases because all were confirmatory tests based
on pre-analysis plans. This maximizes the interpretability of the replication P values and effect
estimates. If publication, selection, and reporting
biases completely explain the effect differences,
then the replication estimates would be a better
estimate of the effect size than would the metaanalytic and original results. However, to the
extent that there are other influences, such as
moderation by sample, setting, or quality of replication, the relative bias influencing original and
replication effect size estimation is unknown.

Data points scaled by power of the replication based on original study effect size. Dotted red lines
indicate P = 0.05 criterion. Subplot below shows P values from the range between the gray lines (P = 0
to 0.005) in the main plot above.

The overall replication evidence is summarized in
Table 1 across the criteria described above and
then separately by journal/discipline. Considering
significance testing, reproducibility was stronger
in studies and journals representing cognitive psychology than social psychology topics. For example, combining across journals, 14 of 55 (25%) of
social psychology effects replicated by the P <
0.05 criterion, whereas 21 of 42 (50%) of cognitive psychology effects did so. Simultaneously, all
journals and disciplines showed substantial and
similar [c2(3) = 2.45, P = 0.48] declines in effect
size in the replications compared with the original
studies. The difference in significance testing results between fields appears to be partly a function
of weaker original effects in social psychology
studies, particularly in JPSP, and perhaps of the
greater frequency of high-powered within-subjects
manipulations and repeated measurement designs
in cognitive psychology as suggested by high power
despite relatively small participant samples. Further, the type of test was associated with replication success. Among original, significant effects,
23 of the 49 (47%) that tested main or simple
effects replicated at P < 0.05, but just 8 of the 37
(22%) that tested interaction effects did.
Correlations between reproducibility indicators and characteristics of replication and original studies are provided in Table 2. A negative
correlation of replication success with the original study P value indicates that the initial
strength of evidence is predictive of reproducibility. For example, 26 of 63 (41%) original studies
with P < 0.02 achieved P < 0.05 in the replication,
whereas 6 of 23 (26%) that had a P value between 0.02 < P < 0.04 and 2 of 11 (18%) that had
a P value > 0.04 did so (Fig. 2). Almost two thirds
(20 of 32, 63%) of original studies with P < 0.001
had a significant P value in the replication.
Larger original effect sizes were associated
with greater likelihood of achieving P < 0.05 (r =
0.304) and a greater effect size difference between
original and replication (r = 0.279). Moreover,
replication power was related to replication success via significance testing (r = 0.368) but not
with the effect size difference between original
and replication (r = –0.053). Comparing effect
sizes across indicators, surprisingness of the
original effect, and the challenge of conducting
the replication were related to replication success for some indicators. Surprising effects were
less reproducible, as were effects for which it was
more challenging to conduct the replication.
Last, there was little evidence that perceived
importance of the effect, expertise of the original
or replication teams, or self-assessed quality of
the replication accounted for meaningful variation

in reproducibility across indicators. Replication
success was more consistently related to the
original strength of evidence (such as original
P value, effect size, and effect tested) than to
characteristics of the teams and implementation
of the replication (such as expertise, quality, or
challenge of conducting study) (tables S3 and S4).
Discussion
No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined
here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively, these results
offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the
original findings (31) despite using materials
provided by the original authors, review in
advance for methodological fidelity, and high
statistical power to detect the original effect sizes.
Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent
with the conclusion that variation in the strength
of initial evidence (such as original P value) was
more predictive of replication success than was
variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and
expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but the evidence is that
they did not systematically do so here. Other
investigators may develop alternative indicators
to explore further the role of expertise and quality in reproducibility on this open data set.
Insights on reproducibility
It is too easy to conclude that successful replication means that the theoretical understanding of
aac47 16-6

28 AUGUST 2015 • VOL 349 ISSUE 6251

the original finding is correct. Direct replication
mainly provides evidence for the reliability of a
result. If there are alternative explanations for
the original finding, those alternatives could likewise account for the replication. Understanding
is achieved through multiple, diverse investigations that provide converging support for a theoretical interpretation and rule out alternative
explanations.
It is also too easy to conclude that a failure to
replicate a result means that the original evidence was a false positive. Replications can fail
if the replication methodology differs from the
original in ways that interfere with observing
the effect. We conducted replications designed
to minimize a priori reasons to expect a different result by using original materials, engaging original authors for review of the designs,
and conducting internal reviews. Nonetheless,
unanticipated factors in the sample, setting, or
procedure could still have altered the observed
effect magnitudes (32).
More generally, there are indications of cultural practices in scientific communication that
may be responsible for the observed results. Lowpower research designs combined with publication
bias favoring positive results together produce
a literature with upwardly biased effect sizes
(14, 16, 33, 34). This anticipates that replication
effect sizes would be smaller than original studies
on a routine basis—not because of differences
in implementation but because the original study
effect sizes are affected by publication and reporting bias, and the replications are not. Consistent
with this expectation, most replication effects were

Implications and limitations
The present study provides the first open, systematic evidence of reproducibility from a sample of
studies in psychology. We sought to maximize
generalizability of the results with a structured
process for selecting studies for replication. However, it is unknown the extent to which these findings extend to the rest of psychology or other
disciplines. In the sampling frame itself, not all
articles were replicated; in each article, only one
study was replicated; and in each study, only one
statistical result was subject to replication. More
resource-intensive studies were less likely to be
included than were less resource-intensive studies.
Although study selection bias was reduced by
the sampling frame and selection strategy, the
impact of selection bias is unknown.
We investigated the reproducibility rate of psychology not because there is something special
about psychology, but because it is our discipline.
Concerns about reproducibility are widespread
across disciplines (9–21). Reproducibility is not well
understood because the incentives for individual
scientists prioritize novelty over replication (20).
If nothing else, this project demonstrates that it
is possible to conduct a large-scale examination
of reproducibility despite the incentive barriers.
Here, we conducted single-replication attempts of
many effects obtaining broad-and-shallow evidence.
These data provide information about reproducibility in general but little precision about individual effects in particular. A complementary
narrow-and-deep approach is characterized by
the Many Labs replication projects (32). In those,
many replications of single effects allow precise
estimates of effect size but result in generalizability that is circumscribed to those individual
effects. Pursuing both strategies across disciplines,
such as the ongoing effort in cancer biology (35),
would yield insight about common and distinct

smaller than original results, and reproducibility
success was correlated with indicators of the
strength of initial evidence, such as lower original
P values and larger effect sizes. This suggests publication, selection, and reporting biases as plausible
explanations for the difference between original
and replication effects. The replication studies significantly reduced these biases because replication
preregistration and pre-analysis plans ensured
confirmatory tests and reporting of all results.
The observed variation in replication and
original results may reduce certainty about the
statistical inferences from the original studies
but also provides an opportunity for theoretical
innovation to explain differing outcomes, and
then new research to test those hypothesized
explanations. The correlational evidence, for example, suggests that procedures that are more
challenging to execute may result in less reproducible results, and that more surprising
original effects may be less reproducible than
less surprising original effects. Further, systematic, repeated replication efforts that fail to identify conditions under which the original finding
can be observed reliably may reduce confidence
in the original finding.

Conclusion
After this intensive effort to reproduce a sample
of published psychological findings, how many
of the effects have we established are true? Zero.
And how many of the effects have we established
are false? Zero. Is this a limitation of the project
design? No. It is the reality of doing science, even
if it is not appreciated in daily practice. Humans
desire certainty, and science infrequently provides
it. As much as we might wish it to be otherwise, a
single study almost never provides definitive resolution for or against an effect and its explanation.
The original studies examined here offered tentative evidence; the replications we conducted offered
additional, confirmatory evidence. In some cases,
the replications increase confidence in the reliability of the original results; in other cases, the
replications suggest that more investigation is
needed to establish the validity of the original
findings. Scientific progress is a cumulative process of uncertainty reduction that can only succeed if science itself remains the greatest skeptic
of its explanatory claims.
The present results suggest that there is room
to improve reproducibility in psychology. Any
temptation to interpret these results as a defeat
for psychology, or science more generally, must
contend with the fact that this project demonSCIENCE sciencemag.org

strates science behaving as it should. Hypotheses abound that the present culture in science
may be negatively affecting the reproducibility
of findings. An ideological response would discount the arguments, discredit the sources, and
proceed merrily along. The scientific process is
not ideological. Science does not always provide
comfort for what we wish to be; it confronts us
with what is. Moreover, as illustrated by the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines
(http://cos.io/top) (37), the research community
is taking action already to improve the quality and
credibility of the scientific literature.
We conducted this project because we care
deeply about the health of our discipline and
believe in its promise for accumulating knowledge about human behavior that can advance
the quality of the human condition. Reproducibility is central to that aim. Accumulating evidence is the scientific community’s method of
self-correction and is the best available option
for achieving that ultimate goal: truth.

challenges and may cross-fertilize strategies so as
to improve reproducibility.
Because reproducibility is a hallmark of
credible scientific evidence, it is tempting to
think that maximum reproducibility of original results is important from the onset of a line
of inquiry through its maturation. This is a
mistake. If initial ideas were always correct,
then there would hardly be a reason to conduct
research in the first place. A healthy discipline
will have many false starts as it confronts the
limits of present understanding.
Innovation is the engine of discovery and is
vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old
news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may
dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this”
belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Deciding the ideal balance of resourcing innovation versus verification is a question of research
efficiency. How can we maximize the rate of
research progress? Innovation points out paths
that are possible; replication points out paths
that are likely; progress relies on both. The ideal
balance is a topic for investigation itself. Scientific
incentives—funding, publication, or awards—can
be tuned to encourage an optimal balance in the
collective effort of discovery (36, 37).
Progress occurs when existing expectations
are violated and a surprising result spurs a new
investigation. Replication can increase certainty
when findings are reproduced and promote
innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings
in psychological research and suggests that there
is still more work to do to verify whether we
know what we think we know.

Empirically analyzing empirical evidence
One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to
demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the
replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing
whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that
about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.
