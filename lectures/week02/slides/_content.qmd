## Philosophy of Science

The title of this course is "Psychology as a Science"

- But what is this thing called "Science"?

- Is it a special way of learning about the world?

- And if it is then what makes it special?

---

## The common-sense view of science

The common-sense view might go something like this:

> Science is special because it is knowledge **based on facts**

Science is often contrasted with other forms of knowledge that might be

- based on authority (e.g., celebrities, religious and political leaders)
- revelation (e.g., personal religious or spiritual experiences)
- superstition (e.g., "knowledge of the ancients")

But this raises two questions:

1. If science is based on facts, then where do "facts" come from?
2. And how is knowledge then derived from these facts

---

## Where do facts come from?

The **common-sense view of science** was formalised by two schools of thought:
The _empiricists_ and the _positivists_

Together they held a view that went something like this:

> _Knowledge should be derived from the facts of experience_

We can break this idea down:

1. Careful and unbiased observers can directly access facts through the
   senses/observation.

2. Facts come before and are independent of, theories.

3. Facts form a firm and reliable base for scientific knowledge.

**But is this true?**

---

## Facts through the senses

A simple story of a how the senses work is that there are some external physical
causes (light, sound waves etc.) that produce some physical changes in our sense
organs (e.g., our eyes) that are then registered by the brain.

This account implies direct and unmediated access to the world through our
senses. But is this actually the case?

- This image could be seen as an old woman or a young woman. Some of you might
  see one and not the other while some might see both and switch between them.

- The physical causes (the light hitting our eyes) is more-or-less the same for
  everyone, but you might "see" different things
:::

---

## Observation is not theory-free

The previous example is just a toy example, but it reveals a larger point:



Two scientists might "observe" something different even when looking at the same
thing.



In some fields, being able to make "observations" actually requires training.

1. Training in how to observe stuff through a microscope

2. Training in how to distinguish different kinds of behaviour

3. Training in how to read an x-ray etc

So a simple claim that observations are "unbiased" or "straightforwardly given
by the senses" seems to be false.

---

## But what do we even mean by facts?

When we think of a "fact" there are two things we could mean

1. "Fact" could refer to some external state of the world

2. Or **statements** about those external states

_The fact that **this university is in East Sussex**_ could refer to this actual
university and its actual being in East Sussex

or it could refer to the statement: "This university is in East Sussex."

When we talk about "facts" as the basis for science, we're talking about these
statements.

We'll call this type of fact an "observation statement."

---

## Do facts come **before** theories?

Think of a child learning the word apple:

<blockquote style="font-size: 90%">
They might initially imitate the word "apple" when shown an apple by their parent.

Next, they might use the word "apple" when pointing to apples

But then one day they might see a tennis ball and say "apple". The parent would
then correct them, and show them that a tennis ball isn't an apple because you
can't, for example, bite into it like an apple

By the time the child can make accurate "observation statements" about the
presence of apples they might already know a lot about the properties of apples
(have an extensive "theory of apples")
</blockquote>

The same goes for scientists; formulating **observation statements** might require
substantial background knowledge or a conceptual framework to place them in.
They aren't completely **independent of theory**

---

## Not just facts, but relevant facts

Let's say that we've been able to acquire some facts. Will any old facts do?

Let's take a simple example:

<blockquote style="font-size: 90%">
You observe that grass grows longer among the cowpats in a field.

You think this is because the dung traps moisture that helps the grass grow.

Your friend thinks this is because the dung acts as a fertiliser

</blockquote>

Observations alone can't distinguish these. To tell which is correct you need to
**intervene** on the situation.

For example, grind up the dung so that it still fertilises the ground or use
something else to trap the moisture.

**Intervening**, for example, through experiment allows you to tell what the
_relevant facts_ of your observation are

---

## Active observation and intervention

By intervening on the system, we can tell which facts are **relevant**

**But** _scientific theories_ may play a part in helping to determine what is
and isn't relevant

<blockquote style="font-size: 90%">
 Example from the history of *cognitive psychology*

In certain kinds of reading tasks psychologists thought it was relevant **that**
people made errors, but they didn't think the **exact nature of the errors** was
relevant.

But after certain kinds of theories were developed (ones based on neural network
models) they came to realise that the particular **kinds of errors** (e.g., if
people swapped letters between words) was relevant.

</blockquote>

In short, observations can't be completely divorced from theories.

And experiments will presume the truth of certain theories (e.g., brain imaging
experiments assume the validity of certain theories about brain function).

---


## "Objectivity"

<blockquote>
Facts don't care about your feelings

</blockquote>

<cite style="text-align: right; display:block; font-style: italic"> — Guy on the
internet</cite>

The idea that science is **objective** in a _simple sense_ of "objectivity" is
misleading.

Your **conceptual framework**, and **theoretical assumptions**, and even your
**knowledge and training** can play **a part** in _what kinds of observations_
you can make or _what types of observation statements you can formulate_

"Objectivity" **[doesn't mean]{.red}** observations free from theoretical
assumptions ("the view from nowhere")

---

### "Objectivity" is more complex

"Objectivity" [does mean]{.green}

- **Publicly** and independently verifiable methods
- **Recognising** theoretical assumptions
- **Theory/data that are open to revision** and improvement
- Free from **avoidable** forms of bias (confounds, cherry picking data,
  experimenter bias)


It is also **objective** in the sense that despite all this, when you make the
observations either the behaviour will happen or it won't, the detector will
flash or it won't etc. _Your theory can't make things happen_.

---


## Deriving theories from facts

The final part of the **common-sense** view of science is that scientific
knowledge is **derived** from facts.

Usually this idea of **derived** means something like **logically derived**. We
might sum up the view like this:

<blockquote>
Science = Facts + Logic
</blockquote>
<cite style="text-align: right; display:block; font-style: italic"> — Guy on the
internet</cite>


To understand what it might mean to **logically** derive scientific knowledge we need to know a bit about **logic**

---

### Deductive logic

A deductive argument is called **valid** if the conclusions follow from the
premises.

:::: {.columns} 
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 85%"}
**Example 1**

1. All research methods lectures are boring
2. This is a research methods lecture
3. (Therefore) this lecture is boring

In this example, if we accept that (1) and (2) are true, then we have to accept
(3) as true. We cannot accept (1) and (2) as true and then deny that (3) is true
because we would be contradicting ourselves.
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 85%"}
**Example 2**

1. Most research methods lectures are boring
2. This is a research methods lecture
3. (Therefore) this lecture is boring

In our new example, we can accept (1) and (2) as true without accepting (3) as
true. That is, (3) does not **necessarily follow** from (1) and (2). It might
just be a case of a research methods lecture that isn't boring. 

::: 

::::

Deduction is only concerned with whether (3) follows from (1) and (2). Not
concerned with determining whether (1) and (2) are true or false. The argument
assumes that (1) and (2) _are_ true, but it doesn't establish **truth**

---

### False but valid

::::{.columns} 

:::{.column width="50%"} 

**Example 3**

1. All pigs can fly
2. Percy is a pig
3. (Therefore) Percy can fly.

:::

:::{.column width="50%"} 

The conclusion is **valid**. However, it is also
**false** because (1) is false.

It is **valid** because if we accept (1) and (2) we can have to accept (3) 

:::

::::

**logic** only tells us what follows from what. If there is truth in our
premises, then there is truth in our conclusions.

If our premises are false, then our conclusions will also be false.

Deductive logic is **truth-preserving**, but it can't tell us what is true and
what is false. And the conclusion is just a _re-statement of the information
contained in the premises_

So **deductive logic** can't create new knowledge. What can you do instead?

We need a way to go from **particular observations** to **generalizations**
(this process is called **induction**)

---


## Induction

We need a way to construct arguments of the following form:

**Premises**

1. Emily the swan is white
2. Kevin the swan is white
3. ... the swan is white

**Conclusion**\
All swans are white


But the problem with arguments like this is that _all the premises may be true
and yet the conclusion can be false_

**Maybe** we just haven't observed the one swan that **isn't white**?

---


## Collecting observations

But surely there are [good]{.green} and [bad]{.red} **inductive** arguments?

- **More** observations better than **fewer** observations—_but how many is
  enough?_

- Observations in many **different contexts**—_but what makes a context
  different and what makes differences **relevant**?_
  - Different contexts should be **novel** in some sense
  - That is, it should **not** just be **trivial** changes

- No **contradicting observations**—_but what about **probabilistic**
  phenomena_?

**Clear** and **simple** rules aren't easy to come by.

But the bigger problem is **induction can never establish truth**.

So how do we ever **prove anything for certain in science**. The short answer
is, **we don't**.

We can **never be certain** of **truth**.

---


## Using induction and deduction

Instead of just **collecting** _confirmations_ we can employ **induction** and
**deduction**

:::: {.columns} 

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","inductive-deductive.png"))
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Collect observations and use **induction** to come up with **general laws**
  and theories from **particular observations**

- Use deduction to figure out what **logically follows** from these general laws
  and theories] 

::: 

::::

This approach nicely captures the idea of **testability**

Our **theories** should make **predictions** about what we **expect to find**
and we can **test** these predictions with more observations

---


## Deduction and knowing what is **false**

The philosopher _Karl Popper_ also saw trouble with relying on **induction**. He
wanted to put science on a firmer logical footing.

To do this, he proposed that while scientists can't use **deduction** to figure
out what is **true**, they can use **deduction** to figure out what is **false**

He suggested that a key quality of **scientific theories** is that they should
be **falsifiable**.

Theories can come into existence through any means (wild speculation, guesses,
dreams, or whatever), but once a theory has been proposed it has to be
**rigorously and ruthlessly tested**

---

### Falsification of theories

::::{.columns} 

:::{.column width="50%"}

**Confirmation**

**Premise:** A swan that was white was spotted in London at time _t_

**Conclusion:** All swans are white.

Conclusion might be **true** or **false**, but it doesn't **logically** follow
from the premise 

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

**Falsification**\

**Premise:** A swan, which was not white, was spotted in Australia at time _t_.

**Conclusion:** Not all swans are white.

Conclusion **logically** follows from the premise, so if the premise is **true**
the conclusion is **true**. 

::: 

::::


We can't **prove** the claim "_all swans are white_", but we can **reject it.**

---


## Degrees of **falsifiability** 

**Good** theories are _falsifiable_, **better** theories are **_more
falsifiable_**

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}

**Three theories:**

1. Mars moves in an elliptical orbit
2. Mars and Venus move in elliptical orbits
3. Planets move in elliptical orbits

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}

Of these three theories, (1) is the least falsifiable and (3) is the most
falsifiable. Why? For theory (1) only an observation of Mars could falsify it.
But for theory (3), an observation Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, or any other
yet undiscovered planet would falsify it.

:::

::::


Bad theories are ones that can seemingly accommodate **any observation**

If **two outcomes** are possible and the theory can explain **outcome one** and
**outcome two** then this is **bad**. What would be **evidence against the
theory**?

**[Good]{.green}** theories are **broad** in their **_applicability_** but
**precise** in their **_predictions_**

---


## Encountering a falsifier

What happens when you make an observation that falsifies a theory?

That is, you observe something that **contradicts** the theory you're testing.
What do you do?

**Your options:**

- You could _abandon the theory_
  - But what about _probabilistic theories_?
  - And what about _auxiliary assumptions_?

- You could _modify or amend the theory_
  - But are their _better_ ways and _worse_ ways to do this?

## Probabilistic theories

Theories in **psychology** tend to be **probabilistic**. They make claims about
how things are **on average**, not claims about how things are **in every
case**.^[A probabilistic claim might say something like _on average_ "men are
taller than women", but of course there are shorter men and taller women.]

Much of what we do with **statistics** is figuring out how to **test** and
**specify** **probabilistic claims**. For example:

- What does it mean for things to be different **on average**
- How many cases do you have to observe before you have **evidence for** a
  probabilistic claim
- How many cases do you have to observe before you have **evidence against** a
  probabilistic claim (that you might previously have believed)

But putting that aside, a **single** contradictory observation can't falsify a
probabilistic claim because we will **sometimes expect** contradictions with
probabilistic claims.

---


## Abandoning the theory

Putting aside the probabilistic nature of claims (or assuming you've seen enough
contradictory examples), should these contradictory observations lead you to
abandon the theory?

Any experiment is not testing **one theory in isolation** but also relies on a
range of auxiliary assumptions and other support theories.

For example, an experiment on memory using brain imaging is also making
assumptions about the truth of theories related to physics and brain
functioning, **besides** testing the theory about memory).

---

### The Duhem-Quine problem

It **may be the case** that what is actually at fault is one of these auxiliary
assumptions and not **your theory**. Telling which part of the **interconnected
web** of theories is at fault can be tricky. Philosophers call this the
_Duhem-Quine problem_.

_Popper_ didn't have a good answer on how to figure out where to lay the blame
for an _apparent_ falsification.

_Popper_ also didn't think that theories should be abandoned _too quickly_.

He suggested some _dogmatism_, because at the start scientists might still be
figuring out the details, and therefore they might just need to make some
_tweaks_ and modify their theories.

## Revising and amending theories

But if we decide to amend a theory, then how do we do this?

**Theory**: All bread is nourishing\
**Observation:** Bread eaten in a French village in 1951 was not
nourishing^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_Pont-Saint-Esprit_mass_poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_Pont-Saint-Esprit_mass_poisoning)]

**[Ad-hoc modification]{.red}**\
_All bread expect bread eaten in a French village in 1951 is nourishing_

Modification has fewer tests: Original theory can be tested by eating any bread.
Modified theory can be tested by eating any bread **except** that particular
bread.

**[Acceptable modification]{.green}**\
_All bread except bread made with flour containing ergot fungus is nourishing_

Modification leads to new tests: 1) Test the bread for the presence of
fungus; 2) Cultivate fungus and make bread with it and test whether it
nourishes; 3) Analyse fungus for poisons.

---

## Problems with Popper's falsificationism

_Popper's_ focus on **falsifying** theories leads to a couple of problems:

1. It can be difficult to figure out when to **abandon** theories and when to
   **amend** theories.

   - Are all parts of the **theoretical web** of the same status?

2. It can difficult to compare two theories to see which is "better"
   - For example, if you have **Theory A** and **Theory B** and neither has been
     falsified, which is the better theory? The one with _more **confirming**
     observations_? But then won't **trivial theories** will always win?

The philosopher _Imre Lakatos_ developed his idea of **research programmes**^[A
_similar_ idea was developed by the philosopher _Thomas Kuhn_, but _Kuhn_ used
the term **paradigms** for his idea.] as a reaction to these two problems.

---


## Research programmes

One key aspect of _Lakatos's_ idea of **research programmes** is that not all
**parts of a science are on par**

- Some laws or principles are so fundamental they might be considered a
  **defining part of the science**.

- Other parts might be more peripheral

_Lakatos_ called these fundamental parts the **hard core** and the more
peripheral parts the **protective belt**

He suggested that the **hard core** is resistant to _falsification_, so when an
apparent falsifier is observed the blame is placed on theories in the
**protective belt**

**Research programmes** are defined by what is in their **hard core**

---

### Hard cores and protective belts

What is in the **hard core** and what is in the **protective belt** might not
always be explicit, but these might be some examples:

- In Cognitive Science the **hard core** might include the theory that
  mind/brain is a _particular kind of computational system_ and the **protective
  belt** might include specific theories about how memory works

- In the biomedical view of mental illness the **hard core** might include the
  theory that mental illness can be explained biochemically and the **protective
  belt** might include the dopamine theory of schizophrenia

When apparent falsifications occur the **protective belt** is up for revision
but the **hard core** stays intact. Falsifying the **hard core** amounts to
abandoning the _research programme_ (more on this later)

---


## Working within a research programme

On _Latakos's_ view, scientists work **within a research programme**.

He split guidelines for working within a research programme into a **negative**
and **positive** heuristic, specifying what scientists **shouldn't** do but also
what they **should** do

- The _negative heuristic_ includes things like not abandoning the **hard core**

- The _positive heuristic_ is harder to specify exactly, but it includes
  suggestions on how to supplement the protective belt to develop the research
  programme further

  - That is, it should specify a **programme of research**

  - The **research programme** should identify problems to solve

---

### Example of a research programme

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: Example of a research programme from Dienes (2008)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","hardcore.png"))
```


---



## Progressive / degenerating programmes

_Lakatos_ was also interested in comparing **research programmes**, something
that is difficult to do on a _strictly_ falsificationist account.

He divided research programmes into those that are **progressive** and those
that are **degenerating**

- Progressive research programmes are coherent (i.e., have minimal
  contradictions)

  - And progressive research programmes make **novel** predictions that **follow
    naturally** from theories that are part of the programmes

  - These predictions are then confirmed by experiments

- Degenerating research programmes are those that have faced so many
  falsifications that they have been modified to the point of being incoherent.

  - At this point, it's no longer sustainable to carry on modifying the
    protective belt, and instead, the hard core must be abandoned

---

### Moving from one programme to another

When the hard core is abandoned then scientists move from one research programme
into a new one.

Some examples of this in psychology might include:

1. The move from psychological behaviourism to cognitive science

2. From classical cognitive science to embodied cognitive science

3. From connectionism to deep neural networks

4. From sociobiology to evolutionary psychology

But again, what is and isn't a **research programme** isn't always clear,
because often the **hard core** and the **protective belt** are left _implicit_
and not made _explicit_

However, I think it's valuable to keep these distinctions in mind as you move
through your university career.
