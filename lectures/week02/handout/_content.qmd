The title of this course is *Psychology as a Science*. But what do we actually
mean when we say something is a "science"?

Science is certainly something that is held in high esteem in public discourse.
"Following the science" or "believing in science" is viewed
positively. Conversely, "denying science" is viewed negatively. This positive
view of science may come from the belief that there is something special about
the "scientific method". We can see this in the fact that "taking a scientific
approach" is often equated with reliability.

```

So we might want to say that science is a _special way of learning about the
world_. But if it is special, then what makes it special?

Answering the question, "what is science" or "what is the _scientific method_"
might seem like something that is easy to do. After-all, many of you might have
a sense that you _know_ what science is. A claim like "science is real" (e.g.,
see @fig-we-believe) certainly implies some sense of knowing what science is,
or at least being able to distinguish between _science_ and _non-science_ or
_pseudo-science_. But when we try and clearly articulate this, we might find
that it isn't actually that easy. In fact, the problem of telling the difference
between _science_ and _non-science_ is a problem that has plagued philosophers
for a very long time. This is something known as the _demarcation problem_.^[If
you want to read a short digestible piece on the demarcation problem
then you can check out the
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem). If you're
looking for something more philosophically heavy, then you can check out the
page on
[Science and Pseudo-Science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/)
at the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy
]

A lot of work on the _demarcation problem_ has focused on examining
_methods_---that is, it has looked at whether there is something like _"the
scientific method"_ that might mark science out as special. In this lecture,
we'll look at some of the prominent approaches for attempting to mark out
something like _"the scientific method"_.

You might be asking yourself, "what is the point of this?" First, I'll be clear
about what the aim **is not**. The aim of this lecture **is not** to give you an
answer to the question "What is science?" or "What is the scientific method?".
If I'm not going to answer these questions, then what **am I going to do?**

The aim of today is to get **you to start thinking about what you think science
is**. I want you to apply that same kind of inquisitiveness that you might apply
to thinking about a _scientific problem_ to the problem of thinking about _what
science is_. I want you to start thinking deeply about _how we get to learn
about the world_--about what it means to _know something about the world_. I
want you to do this, because I think in the long run it'll make you a better
scientist. I don't expect you to have all the answers in your first year. As you
progress in your scientific career---whether that lasts the duration of your
degree or longer---you'll learn more, and your views might change. _Willingness
to change your mind when new information becomes known_ is, after all, another
feature often associated with science, so I expect your answer to the question
"what is science?" to change as you learn more. So I don't expect you to have
the answer now, but I want you to start _thinking about it_.

## The common-sense view of science

The common-sense view of science might go something like this:

> Science is special because it's knowledge **based on facts**

By framing _science_ in this way, it's often contrasted with other forms of
knowledge that might be, based on authority (e.g., celebrities, religious and
political leaders), revelation (e.g., personal religious or spiritual
experiences), or superstition (e.g., "knowledge of the ancients").

But by saying that science is **based on facts** immediately raises two
questions: (1) If science is based on facts, then where do "facts" come from?
(2) And how is knowledge then derived from these facts?

The **common-sense view of science** was formalised by two schools of thought:
The _empiricists_ and the _positivists_. Together they held a view that went
something like this:

> _Knowledge should be derived from the facts of experience_

We can break this idea down:

1. Careful and unbiased observers can directly access facts through the
   senses/observation.

2. Facts come before, and are independent of, _theories_.

3. Facts form a firm and reliable base for scientific knowledge.

_But is this true?_

### Access through the senses

First, let us think about the idea that we can _directly access facts through
the senses_. A simple story about how the senses work is that there are some
external physical causes (light, sound waves etc.) that produce some physical
changes in our sense organs (e.g., our eyes). These changes are then registered
by the brain.

This account implies direct and unmediated access to the world through our
senses. But is this actually the case?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "50%"
#| label: fig-dual-image
#| fig-cap: An example of an ambiguous image
#| cap-location: bottom

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","my_wife_and_my_mother_in_law.jpg"))
```

The image in @fig-dual-image is an example of an _ambiguous image_. This image
could be seen as an old woman or a young woman. Some of you might see one and
not the other. Some of you might be able to see both and switch between the two
percepts. Whichever you see, the physical causes (the light hitting our eyes) is
more-or-less the same for everyone. But you might "see" different things.
Although this is just a toy example, it reveals a larger point: Two scientists
might _"observe"_ something different even when _looking at the
same thing._

In some fields, being able to make "observations" actually requires training.
This training might, for example, be in how to make observations through a
microscope, training in how to distinguish different kinds of behaviour, or
training in how to read an x-ray. So a simple claim that observations are
"unbiased" or "straightforwardly given by the senses" seems to be false.

### But what do we even mean by "facts"?

The second part of the common-sense view of science has to do with _"facts"_.
When we think of a "fact" there are two things we could mean. First, a "fact"
could refer to some external state of the world. Or second, "fact", might refer
to **statements** about those external states. That is, things we _say_ about
the external world.

This distinction can be a little tricky, so here is an example. The fact that
**this university is in East Sussex** could refer to this actual university and
its actual being in East Sussex. That is, some external state of the world,
independent of what anyone has to say about it or whether anyone has ever said
anything about it. Alternatively, it might refer to the statement: "This
university is in East Sussex."

When we talk about "facts" as the basis for science, we're talking about these
statements. That is, _science_ is what we _say about the world_ rather than just
_the world itself_. We'll call this type of fact---the things we say about the
world---an "observation statement."

Do these facts come **before** theories? Like the common-sense view of science
might suppose? Again, let us think of an example:

Think of a child learning the word apple:

<blockquote>

They might initially imitate the word "apple" when shown an apple by their
parent.

Next, they might use the word "apple" when pointing to apples.

But then one day they might see a tennis ball and say "apple". The parent would
then correct them, and show them that a tennis ball isn't an apple because you
can't, for example, bite into it like an apple.

By the time the child can make accurate "observation statements" about the
presence of apples they might already know a lot about the properties of apples
(have an extensive "theory of apples").

</blockquote>

Although this is just a toy example of a child learning about the world, we
might see it as analogous to how a scientist learns about the world. The
takeaway here is that _formulating observation statements_ (the _facts_ that
form the basis of science) is no simple task. Formulating observation statements
might require substantial background knowledge or a conceptual framework to
place them in. So **observation statements** aren't completely **independent of
theory**.

But let's say that we've been able to acquire some facts---whatever that might
exactly mean. Will any old facts do?

Again, let's take a simple example:

<blockquote>

You observe that grass grows longer among the cowpats in a field.

You think this is because the dung traps moisture that helps the grass grow.

Your friend thinks this is because the dung acts as a fertiliser

</blockquote>

Observations alone can't distinguish these two explanations. To tell which is
correct you need to **intervene** on the situation.

For example, you might grind up the dung so that it still fertilises the ground.
Or you might use something else to trap the moisture. **Intervening** on the
world, for example, through experiment allows you to tell what the _relevant
facts_ of your observation are.

By intervening on the system, we can tell which facts are **relevant**, but your
_scientific theories_ may play a part in helping to determine what is and isn't
relevant. We can see this with another example. This time from the history of
_cognitive psychology_.

<blockquote>

In certain kinds of reading tasks psychologists thought it was relevant **that**
people made errors, but they didn't think the **exact nature of the errors** was
relevant.

But after certain kinds of theories were developed (ones based on neural network
models) they came to realise that the particular **kinds of errors** (e.g., if
people swapped letters between words) was relevant to understanding how people
learn to read.

The _nature of the errors_ which was once thought of as **irrelevant** now became
**relevant**.

</blockquote>

In short, observations can't be completely divorced from theories.

## "Objectivity"

<blockquote>

Facts don't care about your feelings

</blockquote>

<cite> Guy on the internet</cite>

What the preceding ideas are trying to get to is the idea of
**objectivity**. But the idea that science is **objective** in a _simple sense_
of "objectivity" is misleading. Your **conceptual framework**, **theoretical
assumptions**, and even your **knowledge and training**, can play **a part** in
your _observations_ and can influence the _observation
statements_ you can make.

"Objectivity" **doesn't mean** observations free from theoretical assumptions
("the view from nowhere"). **Objectivity** is more complex.

"Objectivity" **does mean**:

- **Publicly** and independently verifiable methods

- **Recognising** theoretical assumptions

- **Theory/data that are open to revision** and improvement

- Free from **avoidable** forms of bias (confounds, cherry picking data,
  experimenter bias)

We might also say that science is **objective** in the sense that despite all
this, when you make the observations either the behaviour will happen or it
won't, the detector will flash or it won't etc. _Your theory can't make things
happen_.

## Deriving theories from facts

The last part of the **common-sense** view of science is that facts form the
basis of scientific knowledge---that is, that scientific knowledge is
**derived** from facts.

Usually this idea of **derived** means something like **logically derived**. We
might sum up the view like this:

<blockquote>
Science = Facts + Logic
</blockquote>

<cite >
Guy on the internet
</cite>

To understand what it might mean to **logically** derive scientific knowledge we
need to know a bit about **logic**.

### Deductive logic

A deductive argument is called **valid** if the conclusions follow from the
premises. Let us take a look at two examples:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

**Example 1**

1. All research methods lectures are boring
2. This is a research methods lecture
3. (Therefore) this lecture is boring

In this example, if we accept that (1) and (2) are true, then we have to accept
(3) as true. We cannot accept (1) and (2) as true and then deny that (3) is true
because we would be contradicting ourselves.

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"} 

**Example 2**

1. Most research methods lectures are boring
2. This is a research methods lecture
3. (Therefore) this lecture is boring

In our new example, we can accept (1) and (2) as true without accepting (3) as
true. That is, (3) does not **necessarily follow** from (1) and (2). This might
just be a case of a research methods lecture that isn't boring. 

:::

::::

Deduction is only concerned with whether (3) follows from (1) and (2). It is not
concerned with determining whether (1) and (2) are true or false. The argument
assumes that (1) and (2) _are_ true, but it doesn't establish **truth**.

This means that conclusions can be **false** but **valid**.

::: {.columns} 

::: {.column width="50%"} 

**Example 3**

1. All pigs can fly
2. Percy is a pig
3. (Therefore) Percy can fly.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"} 

The conclusion is **valid**. However, it is also **false** because (1) is false.

It is **valid** because if we accept (1) and (2) we have to accept (3) 

:::

::::

**Logic** only tells us what follows from what. If there is truth in our
premises, then there is truth in our conclusions. If our premises are false,
then our conclusions will also be false.

Deductive logic is **truth-preserving**, but it can't tell us what is true and
what is false. And the conclusion is just a _re-statement of the information
contained in the premises_. So _deductive logic_ can't **create new knowledge**.
What can you do instead?

To _create new knowledge_ we need a way to go from **particular observations**
to **generalizations**. This process is called **induction**.

### Induction

To create new knowledge, we need a way to construct arguments of the following
form:

**Premises**

1. Emily the swan is white
2. Kevin the swan is white
3. ... the swan is white

**Conclusion**\
All swans are white

But the problem with arguments like this is that _all the premises may be true
and yet the conclusion can be false_. **Maybe** we just haven't observed the one
swan that **isn't white**?

So even though we might not be able to say whether an inductive argument is
**true**, are we able to distinguish between **good** and **bad** inductive
arguments?

We might, for example, say that **more** observations are better than **fewer**
observations. But if so, then _how many observations are enough?_ We might also
want to say that observations need to be made in many **different contexts**.
But _what makes a context different"?_ And what kinds of differences are
_relevant?_ For example, we might want to say that different contexts should be
_novel_ in some sense. Or that we should not just make _trivial changes_.
Finally, we might want to say that good inductive arguments have no
**contradicting observations**. But where does this leave us with
**probabilistic** phenomena, where the phenomenon of interest might not happen
every time?

**Clear** and **simple** rules aren't easy to come by. But the bigger problem is
**induction can never establish truth**.

So how do we ever **prove anything for certain in science?**. The short answer
is, **we don't**. We can **never be certain** of **truth**. This might feel like
it leaves us on very uncomfortable ground. And this is a realisation that has
certainly troubled a lot of philosophers of science. As a result, some
philosophers have tried to come up with a way to put science on a firmer logical
footing. And this is where we turn our attention to next.

## Falsification

Instead of just **collecting** _confirmations_ we can use **induction** and
**deduction** together (see @fig-inductive-deductive).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| label: fig-inductive-deductive
#| fig-cap: Using induction and deduction together
#| cap-location: bottom
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","inductive-deductive.png"))
```

To do this, we might collect observations and then use **induction** to come up
with **general laws** and theories from these **particular observations**. We
might then use **deduction** to figure out what **logically follows** from these
general laws and theories.

This approach nicely captures the idea of **testability**. Our **theories**
should make **predictions** about what we **expect to find**, and we can **test**
these predictions with more observations.

The philosopher _Karl Popper_ also saw trouble with relying on **induction**. He
wanted to put science on a firmer logical footing. To do this, he proposed that
while scientists can't use **deduction** to figure out what is **true**, they
can use **deduction** to figure out what is **false**! He suggested that a key
quality of **scientific theories** is that they should be **falsifiable**.

Theories can come into existence through any means (wild speculation, guesses,
dreams, or whatever), but once a theory has been proposed it has to be
**rigorously and ruthlessly tested**.

To see how **falsification** works in practise we'll take a look at another
example.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"} 

**Confirmation**\
**Premise:** A swan that was white was spotted in London at time _t_

**Conclusion:** All swans are white.

The conclusion might be **true** or **false**, but it doesn't **logically**
follow from the premise. 

:::

:::{.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"} 

**Falsification**\
**Premise:** A swan, which was not white, was spotted in Australia at time _t_.

**Conclusion:** Not all swans are white.

The conclusion **logically** follows from the premise, so if the premise is
**true** the conclusion is **true**. 

:::

::::

In short, we can't **prove** the claim "_all swans are white_". But we can
**reject it.**

Popper also suggested that falsifiability can come in degrees. **Good** theories
are _falsifiable_, **better** theories are _**more falsifiable**_.

Below we have some example theories:

1. Mars moves in an elliptical orbit

2. Mars and Venus move in elliptical orbits

3. Planets move in elliptical orbits

Of these three theories, (1) is the least falsifiable and (3) is the most
falsifiable. Why? For theory (1) only an observation of Mars could falsify it.
But for theory (3), an observation of Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, or any other
yet undiscovered planet would falsify it. That is, there are more possible
observations that can count against it.

This is in contrast to bad theories. Bad theories are ones that can seemingly
accommodate **any observation**. If **two outcomes** are possible and the theory
can explain both then this is **bad**. If it can account for both possible
observations then what would be **evidence against the theory**?

In short, we can say that **good** theories are **broad** in their
_**applicability**_ but **precise** in their _**predictions**_!

### Encountering a falsifier

Once you have a theory that _can_ be falsified, what actually happens when you
make an observation that falsifies the theory? That is, what do you do when you
observe something that **contradicts** the theory you're testing. There are at
least a couple of options.

First, you could **abandon your theory**. But what happens if you have a
probabilistic theory? Your theory might say that you should observe **phenomena
A** and you fail to observe it, but your theory might also say that it might not occur
_every single time_. And what of _auxiliary assumptions?_ Maybe your
observations rely on a brain imaging machine, and you have certain assumptions
about how that machine works and it's ability to actually detect the things you
want to observe.

Alternatively, if you don't want to abandon your theory you might instead choose
to **modify or amend it**. But are there better ways and worse ways of
doing this? Let us dive into some of these issues in a little more detail.

First, the issue of probabilistic theories. Theories in **psychology** often
tend to be **probabilistic**. They make claims about how things are **on
average**, not claims about how things are **in every case**.^[A probabilistic
claim might say something like _on average_ "men are taller than women", but of
course there are shorter men and taller women. ] So knowing how to deal
with probabilistic theories will be very important. Much of what we do with
**statistics** is figuring out how to **test** and **specify** **probabilistic
claims**. For example, what does it mean for things to be different **on
average**? How many cases do you have to observe before you have **evidence
for** a probabilistic claim? And how many cases do you have to observe before
you have **evidence against** a probabilistic claim (that you might previously
have believed).

But putting that aside, a **single** contradictory observation can't falsify a
probabilistic claim because we will **sometimes expect** contradictions with
probabilistic claims.

Let us, for now, just assume that you have a simpler non-probabilistic theory.
Should contradictory observations now lead you to abandon it? You might
not want to abandon your theory too quickly. Any experiment is not just testing
**one theory in isolation** but also relies on a range of _auxiliary
assumptions_ and other support theories. For example, an experiment on memory
using brain imaging is also making assumptions about the truth of theories
related to physics and brain function, **besides** testing the theory about
memory.

It **may be the case** that what is actually at fault is one of these auxiliary
assumptions and not **your theory**. Telling which part of the **interconnected
web** of theories is at fault can be tricky. Philosophers call this the
_Duhem-Quine problem_. _Popper_ didn't have a good answer on how to figure out
where to lay the blame for an _apparent_ falsification. It's certainly not an
easy question to answer. But Popper also didn't think that theories should be
abandoned _too quickly_.

Instead of quickly abandoning theories in the face of a falsifier, Popper instead
suggested some _dogmatism_. He pointed out that early on in some scientific
field scientists might still be figuring out the details of their theories and
assumptions. Therefore, they might need to make some _tweaks_ and 
modifications rather than simply abandoning theories completely.

### Revising and amending theories

If we do decide to amend a theory rather than abandoning it, then how do we do
this? Are there good ways and bad ways to modify theories? Popper considered
_ad-hoc_ modifications to be bad. But he also thought that it was possible to
come up with acceptable modifications. To see the difference between these two,
let us examine the following theory:

**Theory**: All bread is nourishing

Once we have this theory, we might make the following observation that seemingly
falsifies it:

**Observation:** Bread eaten in a French village in 1951 was not
nourishing^[This is based on the true story of the Pont-Saint-Esprit mass
poisoning. You can read more on
[wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_Pont-Saint-Esprit_mass_poisoning)]

Now that we've encountered the falsifying observation we can choose to make a
modification to our theory. I might make a modification as follows:

**Modification:** _All bread except bread eaten in a French village in 1951 is
nourishing_

However, if we examine this modification, we can see that it has fewer tests.
That is, the original theory can be tested by eating **any** bread. The modified
theory can be tested by eating any bread **except** that particular bread.
Because our modified theory has fewer tests than our original theory our
modified theory is worse. Is there a way to modify theories that doesn't make
them worse? Wouldn't it be better if our modifications could actually make the
theory better? Here is another example of a modification to our theory:

**Modification:** _All bread except bread made with flour containing ergot
fungus is nourishing_

This modification has made our theory better, because the modification
leads to new tests. For example, we could now test the bread for the presence
of fungus. Or we could cultivate the fungus and make bread with it and test
whether it nourishes. Or we could analyse the fungus for poisons. All these new
tests create new chances to encounter possible falsifiers and, therefore, our
modification has improved upon our original theory.

## Research programmes

_Popper's_ approach is, however, not without its problems. His focus on
**falsifying** theories leads to at least a couple of issues. First, it can be
difficult to figure out when to **abandon** theories and when to **amend**
theories. And when parts of the theory are abandoned or modified are all parts
of the **theoretical web** of the same status?

It can also be difficult to compare two theories to see which is "better". What I mean
by this is, if you have **Theory A** and **Theory B** and neither has been
falsified, which is the better theory? One might think that the theory with
_more **confirming** observations_ is better? But then won't **trivial
theories** always win? The philosopher _Imre Lakatos_ developed his idea of
**research programmes**^[A _similar_ idea to Lakatos's idea of research
programmes was developed by the philosopher _Thomas Kuhn_. 
Kuhn used the term **paradigms** for his idea.
] as a reaction to these two problems. Lakatos came to
his view by actually observing how science operates in the real world.

One key aspect of Lakatos's idea of **research programmes** is that not all
**parts of a science are on par**. Some laws or principles are so fundamental
they might be considered a **defining part of the science**. And other parts of
the science might be more peripheral and of lower importance.

Lakatos called these fundamental parts the **hard core** and the more peripheral
parts the **protective belt**. He suggested that the **hard core** is resistant
to _falsification_, so when an apparent falsifier is observed the blame is
placed on theories in the **protective belt**. **Research programmes** are
defined by what is in their **hard core**.

What is in the **hard core** and what is in the **protective belt** might not
always be explicit, but these might be some examples: In Cognitive Science the
**hard core** might include the theory that the mind/brain is a _particular kind
of computational system_ and the **protective belt** might include specific
theories about how memory works. Or in the biomedical view of mental illness the
**hard core** might include the theory that mental illness can be explained
biochemically, and the **protective belt** might include the dopamine theory of
schizophrenia (see @fig-programme for some more examples).

When apparent falsifications occur the **protective belt** is up for revision,
but the **hard core** stays intact. Falsifying the **hard core** amounts to
abandoning the _research programme_. But modifying the **protective belt** is
more commonplace.

On Lakatos's view, scientists work **within a research programme**. He split
guidelines for working within a research programme into a **negative** and
**positive** heuristic, specifying what scientists **shouldn't** do but also
what they **should** do. The _negative heuristic_ includes things like not
abandoning the **hard core**. The _positive heuristic_ is harder to specify
exactly, but it includes suggestions on how to supplement the protective belt to
develop the research programme further. That is, the positive heuristic should
actually specify a **programme of research**---they should identify the
problems that need to be solved.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| label: fig-programme
#| fig-cap: Example of a research programme from Dienes (2008)
#| cap-location: bottom
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","hardcore.png"))
```

Lakatos was also interested in comparing **research programmes**, something that
is difficult to do on a _strictly_ falsificationist account. He divided research
programmes into those that are **progressive** and those that are
**degenerating**.

_Progressive research programmes_ are coherent. That is, they have minimal
contradictions. Progressive research programmes make **novel** predictions that
**follow naturally** from theories that are part of the programme. And these
predictions are then confirmed by experiments.

In contrast, _degenerating research programmes_ are those that have faced so
many falsifications that they have been modified to the point of being
incoherent. At this point, it's no longer sustainable to carry on modifying the
protective belt, and instead, the hard core must be abandoned!

When the hard core is abandoned then scientists move from one research programme
into a new one. We can see some examples of where this might have occurred in
the history of psychology. For example, the move from _psychological
behaviourism_ to _cognitive science_ might be one example. The move from
classical cognitive science to embodied cognitive science, might be another.
Other examples might be the move from connectionism to deep neural networks or
from sociobiology to evolutionary psychology.

But again, what is and isn't a **research programme** isn't always clear,
because often the **hard core** and the **protective belt** are left _implicit_
and not made _explicit_. However, I think it's valuable to keep these
distinctions in mind as you move through your university career. All this might
just help to make you a better scientist.



## What's been left out

There's so much more that I would've loved to have covered in this lecture, but
unfortunately there simply isn't the time. To take just a few: I would've liked to
have been able to cover feminist perspectives on science
(see [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-science/)
if you're interested). I would also have liked to cover the status of indigenous and non-western epistemology.
For example, I grew up in Aotearoa New Zealand where Mātauranga Māori is
currently having a renaissance [see @ref2;@ref1 if you're interested]. And I
would have also have liked to cover work on Race, Racism, and Colonialism---for
example, see the work of @ref3 if you're interested.

Hopefully, however, there was enough in this lecture to get you to start
thinking more deeply about what science is, and hopefully that will make you a
better scientist.
