## Welcome to Psychology as a Science

The aim of today's lecture is to provide you with an overview of the structure
of the research methods modules that you'll be taking in your degree. I'll also
try to give you some tips that will help you to succeed in this course. Although
this is not an inherently difficult course a lot of the material you'll be
encountering may be new to you. Some of it might even seem a little intimidating
(especially the programming stuff that you'll be doing in the practical
classes). But if you stick with it, and give it your best shot, then I'm
confident that you'll be able to do well.

### Introductions

The teaching team for Psychology as a Science (PAAS) is made up of three people.
Each of us has different roles and responsibilities. Knowing this will help you
to know who to contact if you need help with something (but see more on
[knowing who to email](#knowing-who-to-email) below).

**Dr Lincoln Colling** (lecture content convenor)

Dr Colling is responsible for the lecture content, and for preparing the final
exam.

**Dr Jenny Terry** (practical content convenor)

Dr Terry is responsible for the content covered in the practical sessions, the
`R` homework activities, and the weekly `R` assessments. She is also responsible
of the lab report, the major piece of written work you'll produce this year.[If
you don't know what `R` is then don't worry---99% of the people taking this
course won't know what `R` is. But you'll learn all about `R` and `RStudio` in
the practical classes.]{.aside}

**Dr Vlad Costin**

Dr Costin, along with Dr Terry, is one of the lead practical lecturers.

## Tips for doing well

The information that most of you will want to know is how to do well in this
course. So we'll get it out of the way right up the front. The single best thing
you can do to do well in this course is simply to _show up to class every week_.
Turning up to _in person_ every week not only means that you'll get exposed to
the lecture content, but you'll also get to meet me, talk to me, meet your
classmates, and talk to them too. So much of what makes university special are
those moments that happen around the classes. And all you need to do to
experience those moments is to show up to class every week.

The second most important thing you can do is to do _all the assessments_. This
is particularly important for the weekly assessments linked to the practical
content. Each of these assessments builds on the one before, so if you fall
behind it can be hard to catch up. Even if you find them difficult you should
still do them. They will get easier!

Start off by being present for everything and the rest will fall into place!

## Finding the information you need

The most important thing you need to know if you want to succeed in the course
(and this is true of all the courses you'll be taking) is how to find the
information you need.

The first place to look for any information is on Canvas. If you're reading this
lecture handout then you've probably already found Canvas. The Canvas page for
this course will be your one-stop shop for almost all the information you need
about this course. Familiarise yourself with it. Especially the front page!
Click all the links, and read through the pages. If you have a question like
"What do I do if I can't make a practical or lecture?", then that information is
on Canvas. If you want to know what the various assessments are for this course,
then that will be on Canvas. If you want to know whether references will be
counted as part of the word count for your report, then that will be on Canvas
too!

There's a lot of information on Canvas. In fact, there's probably too much
information on Canvas, and so it can be a little overwhelming. To help with
this, I have two tips.

First, as I said above, click the links and read through all the pages. But
while you're doing this, keep a bit of paper or a notebook handy. Use this to
note down bits of information, or where to find certain information so you can
check back when you need it. You can also bookmark pages that you think will be
useful later. And when you bookmark a page you can give it a informative title
that is meaningful to you. All this will help you to find the information you
need when you need it. And remember, on any web-page you can hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
<kbd>F</kbd> (windows) or <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> (mac) to search for a 
word, and this might be particularly useful if it's a long page with a lot of 
text and you're just looking for something specific.

Second, check out the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)]({{< var faq >}}). Here
I will list the answers to some questions that I tend to encounter often. You
might just find the answer to your question here. I will try to update this as I
encounter more frequently asked questions, so make sure to check back whenever
you're stuck. And if you have a question that you think your class mates might
also want to know the answer to then click [here]() (this link is also on the
FAQ page) to submit a new Frequently Asked Question, and I'll add it to the
list.

:::{.callout-note}

### Emailing me for information

You might be tempted to just email me as soon as you get stuck for some
information. But remember, there's nearly 600 of you, and I get a lot of email,
so it might take a few days before I can get back to you. So double check the
[FAQ]({{< var faq >}}) and [Canvas]({{< var canvas >}}) before you send that
email, because you might be able to get an instant answer there.

### Knowing who to contact {#knowing-who-to-email}

One thing that is tricky when you're first starting out at university is knowing
who to contact with your queries. Here are a few tips for helping your to figure
out who to contact.

#### Admin queries

Admin queries are any queries than are not directly related to the course
content. For example, if you've been absent from class and you want to inform
somebody, then that's an admin query. If you're meant to have an extension to
hand-in date for an assessment, but it hasn't been correctly applied, then
that's an admin query. If you're unable to submit and assessment because you're
unwell, then that too is an admin query. All admin queries should be directed at
the admin staff.

You can contact the admin staff by emailing them at [](). If you'd specifically
like to report an absence then you can email Psychology Absences at [](). For
more information about Attendance and Absences, check out the
[page on Canvas]().

:::{.callout-important}

Lecturers can't grant extensions for assessments. Please don't email us to ask,
because there's nothing we can do about it.

For information about _Requests for Extended Deadlines_ see the information on
the
[Student Support Unit](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/studentsupport/support-needs/extensionrequests)
page.

:::

#### Queries about course content

The lecturers are you point of content if you have questions about the course
content. Who you contact will depend on what section of the course your question
covers:

**For questions about lecture materials**

If you have a question about material that was covered in one of the regular
weekly lectures then the best person to get in touch with is me (Dr Lincoln
Colling).

I can also help with queries related to the final exam (because the final exam
will only cover the material from the regular weekly lectures).

The best way to get in touch with me is to grab me right after the lecture. I'll
always hang around for a few minutes to answer questions that you might have.
But if you need to run off then you can always book into a drop in session.
There's [information below](#drop-in-sessions) on how to do this.

**For questions about the practical content**

If you have a question about something that was covered in one of your weekly
practical sessions then the best person to contact would be the practical lead
_for your practical_. This will either be Dr Jenny Terry or Dr Vlad Costin.

Your practical lead will also be able to help you out with queries about the
weekly `R` quizzes **For queries about the report**

If you have queries about the report, then the best person to contact is Dr
Jenny Terry.

**For general `R` help**

If you have general `R` and `RStudio` queries, and it not something that need to
be addressed to your practical lead (for example, if it's a general query, and
not, for example, a question about something your lecturer said in class) the
you can go to one of the **R Drop in Sessions**. You _can_ go to any of the R
Drop in Sessions, but try to go to one run by somebody that teaches on PAAS.

To book into an `R`

More information on how to get help with `R` will also be provided in the
practical sessions.

[**Booking a drop in appointment**]{#drop-in-sessions}

Know that you know how to contact, how do you go about actually contacting them?
If it's a question quick question about the lecture content then just come up
and talk to me after class. Or if it's a question about the practical content,
then just ask the lecturer in your practical class. If you question is a little
longer, or if you can't wait until class to ask, then you should book into a
drop in session.

To book into the drop in session you can follow the links on the front page of
the module's canvas page.

## Research methods in Psychology

**Psychology as a Science** is the first of a series of research methods
modules.

Following this, you'll take:

- Analysing Data (next term)

- Discovering Statistics (year 2)

- Quantitative and Qualitative Methods (year 2)

All of these build up to prepare you for the **research dissertation** in your
final year. But they're also a great way to learn a lot of transferable skills
that are useful outside of university, for example:

- How to analyse data

- How to make sense of statistics

- Basic computer programming/coding skills

**Psychology as a Science (PAAS)** covers an introduction to the research
process. Some topics you'll cover include:

- Introduction to Philosophy of Science

- Difference approaches to research including quantitative methods and
  qualitative methods

- Basics of statistical theory

You'll also be introduced to coding in the `R` programming language. You'll
cover the basics of the `R` language, how to process and summarise data, and how
to make plots in `R`.

Along the way we'll work with some of the same data that you'll be using for you
**Cognition in Clinical Contexts** lab report

In **Analysing Data (AD)** you'll learn about the core statistical tests used in
Psychology. You'll also cover moved advanced use of `R`, and you'll learn how to
perform statistical tests in `R`. AD will also give you your first chance to
independently analyse some data.

In **Discovering Statistics (DS)** you'll learn even more advanced statistical
tests, and more in-depth knowledge of `R`.

In the final course, **Quantitative and Qualitative Methods (QQM)** you'll learn
about advanced multivariate statistical techniques. But you'll also learn about
non-statistical approaches such as interviews and discourse analysis.

The work you do in these modules will also connect up with other modules:

1. **Analysing Data** with, for example, **Psychobiology**

2. **Discovering Statistics** with, for example, **Developmental Psychology**

3. And **Quantitative and Qualitative Methods** with, for example, **Social
   Psychology**

Research methods doesn't happen in isolation, but it's connected with everything
else you do in your degree

### Why research methods?

The dominant approach to **training psychologists** is the **scientist
practitioner model**. _Doing research_ is seen as integral to this approach!

Just like _medical doctors_ not only deliver treatments but also _develop_
treatments, the same goes for _psychologists._ As a _psychologist_ you want to
do _what works_ and being able to **read**, **critique**, and **conduct**
research will help you know _what works_ and allow you to develop
_evidence-based care_

Even for those that don't become psychologists research methods is still useful
and the skills you'll learn in your research methods courses will prepare you
for careers in a range of industries including working as a data scientist, in
consultancy, and the civil service and government.

## Structure of this module

Like most research methods modules PAAS is made up of **three** main activities:

1. Weekly lectures

   - One hour each week.

   - Cover research methods, statistics, and theory

   - Note that you'll also have a special lecture one evening in Week 6 that
     will cover research ethics. Check your timetable!

2. Tutorials/Practical preparation homework

   - About an hour a week.

   - Done online or in `R` as preparation for the practical class

3. Practical classes

   - Two hours a week

   - Hands on experience with the `R` programming language

### Assessment Structure

For the assessment there's a 50/50 split between **coursework** and the
**exam**.

There a four parts to the course work. Pay special attention to this section,
because the list on **Sussex Direct** can be a little confusing.

1. **Computer Based Exam** worth 10% due in approximately Week 8

   This will cover the material from the _ethics lecture_ in Wk 6

2. **Computer Based Exam** worth 40% (see below about due date)

   This refers to the weekly `R` assessments that you'll do. You'll find out
   more about these in the practical classes. It is **very important** to note
   that this isn't a single assessment due at the end of term. Rather these are
   continual weekly assessments. Make sure you keep up with them, because doing
   them will really help you acheive a good grade.

3. **Report** worth 40% due in approximately Wk 9

4. **Portfolio** with 10% (listed on Sussex Direct as due in Wk 11)

   This refers to the 20 credits worth of research participation that you're
   required to do as part of the course. To find out more about this follow the
   big yellow link labelled **Research Participation/Sona**.

   The due date is the _final day_ you can complete research participation.
   **Don't wait until the last week** to do it, because there'll probably be no
   studies left to take part in. _These are easy marks so don't miss out on
   getting them._

## Lecture topics

The rough outline of the lecture schedule is as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# TODO: Pull the lecture topics from the .json files
tibble::tribble(
~Week, ~Topic,
1, 'Introduction to PAAS',
2, 'What is this thing called "Science"',
3, 'Approaches to research',
4, 'Measurement and variables',
5, 'Open Science',
6, 'Samples, populations, and distributions',
7, 'Descriptive statistics and the sampling distribution',
8, 'Distributions, functions, and transformations',
9, 'Summarising data in tables and plots',
10, 'Probability theory',
11, 'Recap and exam guide') |>
  knitr::kable(align = c('l','l'))
```

The first set of lectures will cover _big picture_ ideas. These lectures will
probably be most useful in helping you to prepare for the report.

In these lectures we'll talk about issues like:

- What are scientific theories

- What issues do we need to consider when we're measuring things?

- What does it mean to operationalise our variables?

- What are different approaches you can take when conducting a study?

- What are some sources of bias in psychology studies and publishing of
  psychology studies and how might we be able to ameliorate some of these
  biases?

The second set of lectures are all about preparing you for learning about
statistics and working with data.

In these lectures you'll learn the underlying theory of _statistical testing_.
You'll learn how to _reason about statistics and data_, and the relationship
between scientific hypotheses and statistical hypotheses.

Doing statistics isn't like following a recipe. It's **not** about just picking
the **"correct"** statistical tests out of a list. It involving thinking about
what you want to know, why you want to know it, and how statistics can help you
to know it. So we spent a bit of time this term just learning about this
reasoning before you actually learn about statistical tests next term.

# Lecture 2
 
## Introduction

The title of this course is "Psychology as a Science". But what do we actually
mean when we say something is a "science"?

Science is certainly something that is held in high esteem in public discourse.
"Following the science" or "believing in science" are things that are viewed
positively. Conversely, "denying science" is viewed negatively. This positive
view of science may come from the belief that there is something special about
the "scientific method". We can see this in that fact that "taking a scientific
approach" is often equated with reliability.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| label: fig-we-believe
#| fig-cap: An example of a "We Believe" sign that was created in response to the election victory of Donald Trump
#| cap-location: bottom
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","we_believe.jpg"))
```

So we might want to say that science is a _special way of learning about the
world_. But if it is special, then what makes it special?

Answering the question, "what is science" or "what is the _scientific method_"
might seem like something that is easy to do. After-all, many of you might have
a sense that you _know_ what science is. A claim like "science is real" (e.g.,
see @fig-we-believe) certainly implies some sense of know what science is, or at
least being able to distinguish between _science_ and _non-science_ or
_pseudo-science_. But when we try and clearly articulate this, we might find
that it isn't actually that easy. In fact, the problem of telling the difference
between _science_ and _non-science_ is a problem that has plagued philosophers
for a very long time. This is something known as the _demarcation
  problem_.[If you want to read a short digestible piece on the demarcation problem
then you can check out the
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem). If you're
looking for something more philosophically heavy, then you can check out the
page on
[Science and Pseudo-Science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/)
at the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy
]{.aside}
A lot of work on the _demarcation problem_ has focused on examining
_methods_---that is, it has looked at whether there is something like _"the
scientific method"_ that might mark science out as special. In this lecture,
we'll look at some of the prominent approaches for attempting to mark out
something like _"the scientific method"_.

You might be asking yourself, "what is the point of this?" First, I'll be clear
about what the aim **is not**. The aim of this lecture **is not** to give you an
answer to the question "What is science?" or "What is the scientific method?".
My own personal view is that no philosophers have provided satisfactory answers
to these questions. Or at least, they have not provided answers that can be
summarised in a single lecture. So if I'm not going to give you an answer to the
question, "what is science?" then what **am I going to do**?

The aim of today is to get **you to start thinking about what you think science
is**. I want you to apply that same kind of inquisitiveness that you might apply
to thinking about a _scientific problem_ to the problem of thinking about _what
science is_. I want you to start thinking deeply about _how we get to learn
about the world_--about what is means to _know something about the world_. I
want you to do this, because I think in the long run it'll make you a better
scientist. I don't expect you to have all the answers in your first year. As you
progress in your scientific career---whether that lasts the duration of your
degree or longer---you'll learn more and your views might change. _Willingness
to change your mind when new things become known_ is, after all, another feature
often associated with science, so I expect your answer to the question "what is
science?" to change as you learn more. So I don't expect you to have the answer
now, but I want you to start _thinking about it now_.

## The common-sense view of science

The common-sense view might go something like this:

> Science is special because it is knowledge **based on facts**

By framing things in this way _science_ is often contrasted with other forms of
knowledge that might be, based on authority (e.g., celebrities, religious and
political leaders), revelation (e.g., personal religious or spiritual
experiences), or superstition (e.g., "knowledge of the ancients").

But by saying the science is **based on facts** immediately raises two
questions: (1) If science is based on facts, then where do "facts" come from?
(2) And how is knowledge then derived from these facts?

The **common-sense view of science** was formalised by two schools of thought:
The _empiricists_ and the _positivists_

Together they held a view that went something like this:

> _Knowledge should be derived from the facts of experience_

We can break this idea down:

1. Careful and unbiased observers can directly access facts through the
   senses/observation.

2. Facts come before, and are independent of, _theories_.

3. Facts form a firm and reliable base for scientific knowledge.

_But is this true?_

### Access through the senses

First, let us thinking about the idea that we can _directly access facts through
the senses_. A simple story of a how the senses work is that there are some
external physical causes (light, sound waves etc.) that produce some physical
changes in our sense organs (e.g., our eyes) that are then registered by the
brain.

This account implies direct and unmediated access to the world through our
senses. But is this actually the case?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "50%"
#| label: fig-dual-image
#| fig-cap: An example of an ambiguous image
#| cap-location: bottom

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","my_wife_and_my_mother_in_law.jpg"))
```

The image is @fig-dual-image is an example of an _ambiguous image_. This image
could be seen as an old woman or a young woman. Some of you might see one and
not the other. Some of you might be able to see both and switch between the two
precepts. Whether you see the young woman or the old woman, the physical causes
(the light hitting our eyes) is more-or-less the same for everyone. But you
might "see" different things.

Although this is just a toy example, it reveals a larger point:

<blockquote>

Two scientists might _"observe"_ something different even when _looking at the
same thing._

</blockquote>

In some fields, being able to make "observations" actually requires training.
This training might, for example, be in how to observe stuff through a
microscope, training in how to distinguish different kinds of behaviour, or
training in how to to read an x-ray.

I So a simple claim that observations are "unbiased" or "straightforwardly given
by the senses" seems to be false.

### But what do we even mean by "facts"?

The second part of the this common-sense view of science has to do with
_"facts"_. When we think of a "fact" there are two things we could mean. First,
a "fact" could refer to some external state of the world. Or second, by "fact",
we might be **statements** about those external states. That is, things we _say_
about the external world.

This distinction can be a little tricky, so here is an example. The fact that
**this university is in East Sussex** could refer to this actual university and
its actual being in East Sussex. That is, some external state of the world,
independent of what anyone has to say about it or whether anyone has ever said
anything about it. Alternatively, it might refer to the statement: "This
university is in East Sussex."

When we talk about "facts" as the basis for science, we're talking about these
statements. That is, _science_ is what we _say about the world_ rather than just
_the world itself_. We'll call this type of fact---the things we say about the
world---an "observation statement."

Do these facts come **before** theories? Like the common-sense view of science
might suppose? Again, let us thing of an example:

Think of a child learning the word apple:

<blockquote>

They might initially imitate the word "apple" when shown an apple by their
parent.

Next, they might use the word "apple" when pointing to apples

But then one day they might see a tennis ball and say "apple". The parent would
then correct them, and show them that a tennis ball isn't an apple because you
can't, for example, bite into it like an apple

By the time the child can make accurate "observation statements" about the
presence of apples they might already know a lot about the properties of apples
(have an extensive "theory of apples")

</blockquote>

Although this is just a toy example of a child learning about the world, we
might see it as analogous to how a scientist learns about the world. The
takeaway here is that _formulating observation statements_ (the _facts_ that
form the basis of science) is no simple task. Formulating observation statements
might require substantial background knowledge or a conceptual framework to
place them in.

So **observation statements** aren't completely **independent of theory**.

Let's say that we've been able to acquire some facts---whatever that might
exactly mean. Will any old facts do?

Again, let's take a simple example:

<blockquote>
You observe that grass grows longer among the cowpats in a field.

You think this is because the dung traps moisture that helps the grass grow.

Your friend thinks this is because the dung acts as a fertiliser

</blockquote>

Observations alone can't distinguish these two explanations. To tell which is
correct you need to **intervene** on the situation.

For example, you might grind up the dung so that it still fertilises the ground.
Or you might use something else to trap the moisture. **Intervening** on the
world, for example, through experiment allows you to tell what the _relevant
facts_ of your observation are.

By intervening on the system, we can tell which facts are **relevant**, but your
_scientific theories_ may play a part in helping to determine what is and isn't
relevant. We can see this will another example. This time from the history of
_cognitive psychology_.

<blockquote>
In certain kinds of reading tasks psychologists thought it was relevant **that**
people made errors, but they didn't think the **exact nature of the errors** was
relevant.

But after certain kinds of theories were developed (ones based on neural network
models) they came to realise that the particular **kinds of errors** (e.g., if
people swapped letters between words) was relevant to understanding how people
learn to read.

The _nature of the errors_ which was once thought of a **irrelevant** now became
**relevant**.

</blockquote>

In short, observations can't be completely divorced from theories.

## "Objectivity"

<blockquote>
Facts don't care about your feelings

</blockquote>

<cite> Guy on the internet</cite>

What a lot of the preceding ideas are trying to get to is the idea of
**objectivity**. But the idea that science is **objective** in a _simple sense_
of "objectivity" is misleading. Your **conceptual framework**, and **theoretical
assumptions**, and even your **knowledge and training** can play **a part** in
_what kinds of observations_ you can make or _what types of observation
statements you can formulate_

"Objectivity" **doesn't mean** observations free from theoretical assumptions
("the view from nowhere"). **Objectivity** is more complex.

"Objectivity" **does mean**

- **Publicly** and independently verifiable methods

- **Recognising** theoretical assumptions

- **Theory/data that are open to revision** and improvement

- Free from **avoidable** forms of bias (confounds, cherry picking data,
  experimenter bias)

We might also say that science is **objective** in the sense that despite all
this, when you make the observations either the behaviour will happen or it
won't, the detector will flash or it won't etc. _Your theory can't make things
happen_.

## Deriving theories from facts

The last part of the **common-sense** view of science is that facts form the
basis of scientific knowledge---that is, that scientific knowledge is
**derived** from facts.

Usually this idea of **derived** means something like **logically derived**. We
might sum up the view like this:

<blockquote>
Science = Facts + Logic
</blockquote>

<cite >
Guy on the internet
</cite>

To understand what it might mean to **logically** derive scientific knowledge we
need to know a bit about **logic**.

### Deductive logic

A deductive argument is called **valid** if the conclusions follow from the
premises. Let us take a look at two examples:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

**Example 1**

1. All research methods lectures are boring
2. This is a research methods lecture
3. (Therefore) this lecture is boring

In this example, if we accept that (1) and (2) are true, then we have to accept
(3) as true. We cannot accept (1) and (2) as true and then deny that (3) is true
because we would be contradicting ourselves.

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"} 

**Example 2**

1. Most research methods lectures are boring
2. This is a research methods lecture
3. (Therefore) this lecture is boring

In our new example, we can accept (1) and (2) as true without accepting (3) as
true. That is, (3) does not **necessarily follow** from (1) and (2). It might
just be a case of a research methods lecture that isn't boring. 

:::

::::

Deduction is only concerned with whether (3) follows from (1) and (2). It is not
concerned with determining whether (1) and (2) are true or false. The argument
assumes that (1) and (2) _are_ true, but it doesn't establish **truth**.

This means that conclusions can be **false** but **valid**.

::: {.columns} 

::: {.column width="50%"} 

**Example 3**

1. All pigs can fly
2. Percy is a pig
3. (Therefore) Percy can fly.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"} 

The conclusion is **valid**. However, it is also
**false** because (1) is false.

It is **valid** because if we accept (1) and (2) we can have to accept (3) 

:::

::::

**Logic** only tells us what follows from what. If there is truth in our
premises, then there is truth in our conclusions. If our premises are false,
then our conclusions will also be false.

Deductive logic is **truth-preserving**, but it can't tell us what is true and
what is false. And the conclusion is just a _re-statement of the information
contained in the premises_. So _deductive logic_ can't **create new knowledge**.
What can you do instead?

To _create new knowledge_ we need a way to go from **particular observations**
to **generalizations**. This process is called is called **induction**.

### Induction

To create new knowledge, we need a way to construct arguments of the following
form:

**Premises**

1. Emily the swan is white
2. Kevin the swan is white
3. ... the swan is white

**Conclusion**\
All swans are white

But the problem with arguments like this is that _all the premises may be true
and yet the conclusion can be false_. **Maybe** we just haven't observed the one
swan that **isn't white**?

So even though might not be able to say whether an inductive argument is true,
it surely seems like we might be able to distinguish between **good** and
**bad** inductive arguments?

We might, for example, say that **more** observations better than **fewer**
observations. But if so, then _how many observation are enough?_ We might also
want to say that observations need to be made in many **different contexts**.
But _what makes a context different"?_ And what kinds of the difference are
_relevant?_ For example, we might want to say that different contexts should be
_novel_ in some sense. Or that we should not just make _trivial changes_.
Finally, we might want to say that good inductive arguments have no
**contradicting observations**. But where does this leave use with
**probabilistic** phenomena, where the phenomenon of interest might not happen
every time?

**Clear** and **simple** rules aren't easy to come by. But the bigger problem is
**induction can never establish truth**.

So how do we ever **prove anything for certain in science?**. The short answer
is, **we don't**. We can **never be certain** of **truth**. This might feel like
it leaves us on very uncomfortable ground. And this is a realisation that has
certainly troubled a lot of philosophers of science. A consequence of this can
been to trying and come up with a way to try and put science on a firmer logical
footing. And this is where we turn our attention to next.

## Falsification

Instead of just **collecting** _confirmations_ we can employ **induction** and
**deduction** together (see @fig-inductive-deductive).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| label: fig-inductive-deductive
#| fig-cap: Using induction and deduction together
#| cap-location: bottom
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","inductive-deductive.png"))
```

To do this, we might collect observations and then use **induction** to come up
with **general laws** and theories from these **particular observations**. We
might then use **deduction** to figure out what **logically follows** from these
general laws and theories.

This approach nicely captures the idea of **testability**. Our **theories**
should make **predictions** about what we **expect to find** and we can **test**
these predictions with more observations

The philosopher _Karl Popper_ also saw trouble with relying on **induction**. He
wanted to put science on a firmer logical footing. To do this, he proposed that
while scientists can't use **deduction** to figure out what is **true**, they
can use **deduction** to figure out what is **false**! He suggested that a key
quality of **scientific theories** is that they should be **falsifiable**.

Theories can come into existence through any means (wild speculation, guesses,
dreams, or whatever), but once a theory has been proposed it has to be
**rigorously and ruthlessly tested**.

To see how **falsification** works in practise we'll take a look at another
example.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"} 

**Confirmation**\
**Premise:** A swan that was white was spotted in London at time _t_

**Conclusion:** All swans are white.

The conclusion might be **true** or **false**, but it doesn't **logically**
follow from the premise. 

:::

:::{.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"} 

**Falsification**\
**Premise:** A swan, which was not white, was spotted in Australia at time _t_.

**Conclusion:** Not all swans are white.

The conclusion **logically** follows from the premise, so if the premise is
**true** the conclusion is **true**. 

:::

::::

In short, we can't **prove** the claim "_all swans are white_". But we can
**reject it.**

Popper also suggested that fallibility can come in degrees. **Good** theories
are _falsifiable_, **better** theories are _**more falsifiable**_.

Below we have some example theories:

1. Mars moves in an elliptical orbit

2. Mars and Venus move in elliptical orbits

3. Planets move in elliptical orbits

Of these three theories, (1) is the least falsifiable and (3) is the most
falsifiable. Why? For theory (1) only an observation of Mars could falsify it.
But for theory (3), an observation Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, or any other
yet undiscovered planet would falsify it. That is, there are more possible
observations that can count against.

This is in contrast to bed theories. Bad theories are ones that can seemingly
accommodate **any observation**. If **two outcomes** are possible and the theory
can explain **outcome one** and **outcome two** then this is **bad**. Because if
it can account for both possible observation then what would be **evidence
against the theory**?

In short, we can say that **good** theories are **broad** in their
_**applicability**_ but **precise** in their _**predictions**_!

### Encountering a falsifier

Once you have a theory that _can_ be falsified, what actually happens when you
make an observation that falsifies a theory? That is, what do you do when you
observe something that **contradicts** the theory you're testing. There are at
least a couple of options.

First, you could **abandon of your theory**. But what happens if you have a
probabilistic? You theory might say that you should observe **phenomena A** and
you fail to observe it, but your theory also say that it might not occur _every
single time_. And what of _auxiliary assumptions?_ Maybe your observations rely
on a brain imaging machine, and you have certain assumptions about how that
machine works and it's ability to actually detect the things you want to
observe.

Alternatively, if you don't want to abandon your theory you might instead choose
to **modify or amend the theory**. But are there better ways and worse ways of
doing this? Let us dive into some of these issues in a little more detail.

First, the issue of probabilistic theories. Theories in **psychology** often
tend to be **probabilistic**. They make claims about how things are **on
average**, not claims about how things are **in every case**.[A probabilistic claim might say something like _on average_ "men are
taller than women", but of course there are shorter men and taller women.
]{.aside} So knowing how
to deal with probabilistic theories will be very important. Much of what we do
with **statistics** is figuring out how to **test** and **specify**
**probabilistic claims**. For example, what does it mean for things to be
different **on average**? How many cases do you have to observe before you have
**evidence for** a probabilistic claim? And how many cases do you have to
observe before you have **evidence against** a probabilistic claim (that you
might previously have believed).

But putting that aside, a **single** contradictory observation can't falsify a
probabilistic claim because we will **sometimes expect** contradictions with
probabilistic claims.

Let us, for now, just assume that you have a simpler non-probabilistic theory.
Should contradictory observations now lead you to abandon the theory? You might
not want to abandon your theory too quickly. Any experiment is not just testing
**one theory in isolation** but also relies on a range of _auxiliary
assumptions_ and other support theories. For example, an experiment on memory
using brain imaging is also making assumptions about the truth of theories
related to physics and brain function, **besides** testing the theory about
memory.

It **may be the case** that what is actually at fault is one of these auxiliary
assumptions and not **your theory**. Telling which part of the **interconnected
web** of theories is at fault can be tricky. Philosophers call this the
_Duhem-Quine problem_. _Popper_ didn't have a good answer on how to figure out
where to lay the blame for an _apparent_ falsification. It's certainly not an
easy question to answer. But _Popper_ also didn't think that theories should be
abandoned _too quickly_.

Instead of quickly abandoning theories in the face of falsifier, Popper instead
suggested some _dogmatism_. He pointed out that early on in some scientific
field scientists might still be figuring out the details of their theories and
assumptions, and therefore they might just need to make some _tweaks_ to their
theories and modify rather than simply abandoning them completely.

### Revising and amending theories

If we do decide to amend a theory rather than abandoning it, then how do we do
this? Are there good ways and bad ways to modify theories? Popper's considered
_ad-hoc_ modifications to be bad. But he also thought that it was possible to
come up with acceptable modifications. To see the difference between these two,
let us examine the following theory:

**Theory**: All bread is nourishing

Once we have this theory, we might make the following observation that seemingly
falsifies it:

**Observation:** Bread eaten in a French village in 1951 was not
nourishing[This is based on the true story of the Pont-Saint-Esprit mass
poisoning. You can read more on
[wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_Pont-Saint-Esprit_mass_poisoning)]{.aside}

Now that we've encountered the falsifying observation we can choose to make a
modification to our theory. A might make a modification as follows:

**Modification:** _All bread expect bread eaten in a French village in 1951 is
nourishing_

However, if we examine this modification, we can see that it has fewer tests.
That is, the original theory can be tested by eating **any** bread. Modified
theory can be tested by eating any bread **except** that particular bread. We
already said that better theories have more tests than worse theories, so
because our modified theory can fewer tests that our original theory our
modified theory is worse. Is there a way to modify theories that doesn't make
them worse? Wouldn't it be better if our modifications could actually make the
theory better? Here is another example of a modification to our theory:

**Modification:** _All bread except bread made with flour containing ergot
fungus is nourishing_

This modification has actually made our theory better, because the modification
has lead to new tests. For example, we could now test the bread for the presence
of fungus. Or we could cultivate the fungus and make bread with it and test
whether it nourishes. Or we could analyse fungus for poisons. All these new
tests create new chances to encounter possibly falsifiers and, therefore, our
modification has actually improved upon our original theory.

## Research programmes

_Popper's_ approach is, however, not without it's problems. His focus on
**falsifying** theories leads to at least a couple of issues. First, it can be
difficult to figure out when to **abandon** theories and when to **amend**
theories. And when parts of the theory are abandoned or modified are all parts
of **theoretical web** of the same status?

It can difficult to compare two theories to see which is "better". What I mean
by this is, if you have **Theory A** and **Theory B** and neither has been
falsified, which is the better theory? One might think that the theory with
_more **confirming** observations_ is better? But then won't **trivial
theories** will always win? The philosopher _Imre Lakatos_ developed his idea of
**research programmes**[A _similar_ idea to Lakatos's idea of research
programmes was developed by the philosopher _Thomas Kuhn_. 
_Kuhn_ used the term **paradigms** for his idea.
]{.aside} as a reaction to these two problems. Lakatos came to
his view by actually observing how science operates in the real world.

One key aspect of Lakatos's idea of **research programmes** is that not all
**parts of a science are on par**. Some laws or principles are so fundamental
they might be considered a **defining part of the science**. And other parts of
the science might be more peripheral and of lower importance.

Lakatos called these fundamental parts the **hard core** and the more peripheral
parts the **protective belt**. He suggested that the **hard core** is resistant
to _falsification_, so when an apparent falsifier is observed the blame is
placed on theories in the **protective belt**. **Research programmes** are
defined by what is in their **hard core**.

What is in the **hard core** and what is in the **protective belt** might not
always be explicit, but these might be some examples: In Cognitive Science the
**hard core** might include the theory that mind/brain is a _particular kind of
computational system_ and the **protective belt** might include specific
theories about how memory works. Or in the biomedical view of mental illness the
**hard core** might include the theory that mental illness can be explained
biochemically and the **protective belt** might include the dopamine theory of
schizophrenia (see @fig-programme for some more examples)

When apparent falsifications occur the **protective belt** is up for revision
but the **hard core** stays intact. Falsifying the **hard core** amounts to
abandoning the _research programme_. But modifying the **protective belt** is
more commonplace.

On Latakos's view, scientists work **within a research programme**. He split
guidelines for working within a research programme into a **negative** and
**positive** heuristic, specifying what scientists **shouldn't** do but also
what they **should** do. The _negative heuristic_ includes things like not
abandoning the **hard core**. The _positive heuristic_ is harder to specify
exactly, but it includes suggestions on how to supplement the protective belt to
develop the research programme further. That is, the positive heuristic should
actually specify a **programme of research**. And their should identify the
problems that need to be solved.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| label: fig-programme
#| fig-cap: Example of a research programme from Dienes (2008)
#| cap-location: bottom
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","hardcore.png"))
```

Lakatos was also interested in comparing **research programmes**, something that
is difficult to do on a _strictly_ falsificationist account. He divided research
programmes into those that are **progressive** and those that are
**degenerating**.

_Progressive research programmes_ are coherent. That is, they have minimal
contradictions. Progressive research programmes make **novel** predictions that
**follow naturally** from theories that are part of the programmes. And these
predictions are then confirmed by experiments.

In contrast, _degenerating research programmes_ are those that have faced so
many falsifications that they have been modified to the point of being
incoherent. At this point, it's no longer sustainable to carry on modifying the
protective belt, and instead, the hard core must be abandoned!

When the hard core is abandoned then scientists move from one research programme
into a new one. We can see some examples of where this might have occurred in
the history of psychology. For example, the move from _psychological
behaviourism_ to _cognitive science_ might be one example. The move from
classical cognitive science to embodied cognitive science, might be another.
Other examples might be the move from connectionism to deep neural networks or
from sociobiology to evolutionary psychology.

But again, what is and isn't a **research programme** isn't always clear,
because often the **hard core** and the **protective belt** are left _implicit_
and not made _explicit_. However, I think it's valuable to keep these
distinctions in mind as you move through your university career. All this might
just help to make you a better scientist.

## What's been left out

There's so much more that I would've loved to have covered in this lecture, but
unfortunately there simply isn't the time. But if you're interested in the
nature of science, and the status of different kinds of knowledge, there are a
few things that I can recommend for you to check out.

# Lecture 3

<!--
TODO: Decide which move parts should  be in footnotes vs asides
-->
Doing research is an integral part of your training as a psychologist. But
before you can start thinking about **doing research** you need to be aware of
the different **approaches** that are available to you. The aim of today's
lecture is to give you an overview of some kinds of approaches available to you.
Research in psychology is incredibly varied and there are many different
approaches available to you.

In this lecture I'll primarily focus on two broad categories of approaches---
qualitative methods, and quantitative methods--but at the end I'll also briefly
mention how computer simulation can be used in psychology research. The current
module, as with most of the research methods modules you'll take in your degree,
is focused on quantitative methods. Therefore, this lecture will be the one
chance we'll have to discuss methods that don't fit neatly under the label
_quantitative_ until you have the chance to take more advanced courses later.

## Introduction to Qualitative and Quantitative methods

Approaches to research are ordinarily split into two **broad categories**. We
can give some _simple_ descriptions of these categories.

1. **Quantitative** methods collect numbers/numerical data and use statistical
   tools

2. **Qualitative** methods collect words, pictures, and artefacts

As we'll see, these are really _approaches_ one might take to asking and
answering a research question and the approaches _don't_ map neatly on to
different subfields of psychology. Some researchers also adopt both approaches
(_mixed-methods_) and some might apply _quantitative methods_ to _qualitative
style_ data. **Quantitative methods** are probably easier to group together,
because many approaches can be grouped under **qualitative methods**. So we'll
start with _quantitative methods_ first.

### Outline of quantitative methods

Quantitative approaches take a phenomenon and try to **condense** it down into a
few dimensions or **variables** that can be **measured** as _precisely and
reliably_ as possible. Because of this, it is very important to choose
**variables** that are **representative** of the phenomenon you're studying.
This process of choosing variables that are representative of the phenomenon
you're interested is called **operationalisation**.

**Operationalisation** means choosing a **measurable** proxy for the phenomenon
you're interested in. This is not always an easy process and involves lots of
careful thought by researchers. How one researcher operationalises a phenomenon
might be different to how another researcher does. And debates between
researchers on exactly how to operationalise some phenomena can be common in the
literature. _Operationalisation_ will be an important part of your lab report.

Quantitative approaches often make use of **statistical methods**. Using
**statistical methods** means looking at lots of cases by, for example, studying
lots of people, not just one or two. The goal with quantitative methods is often
to develop **generalisations**, or theories that are **generally applicable**.
And quantitative methods often involves testing **predictions** that logically
follow from **theories** (the _deductive_ step).^[Refer back Lecture 2 if you're
unsure what _deductive_ means.]

### Outline of qualitative methods

**Qualitative methods** are focused on **meaning** rather than **measurement**.
Instead of **condensing** a phenomenon down **to a simple set of features**
dimensions (as is common in quantitative approaches), **qualitative research**
tries to examine **many features** of a phenomenon. Qualitative approaches can
do this, because instead of examining many instances of a single qualitative
approaches try to look at **all aspects** of one or a few **instances**.

**Qualitative approaches** view the **context** (_physical environment_, _social
setting_, _cultural context_) as a **central** part of the phenomenon being
studied. In contrast, it is common for quantitative approaches to place less
emphasise on the context by abstracting away from it.

Qualitative approaches—for example, **grounded theory** and
**phenomenology**—also emphasise the idea of following the data wherever it
leads (that is, the _inductive_ step).

Qualitative methods is an umbrella term for a wide range of different
methodologies. Each of these will have their own underlying theoretical
assumptions and intellectual histories. I can't do justice to them all in one
short lecture. In fact, just one of these approaches would require an entire
course to itself if you were to learn enough about it to be able to apply it to
your own research. So instead what I'll do is just pick out a few and highlight
their key features.

The methods I have chosen are: (1) Verbal protocol analysis, (2) ethnographic
methods, (3) discourse analysis, and (4) phenomenology. However, there are many
more, including Case Studies, Grounded Theory, Participatory Research, Focus
Groups, to name just a few.

I'll try to draw out some contrasts between **qualitative** and **quantitative**
methods more generally and highlight **strengths** and **weaknesses** of each
approach.

## Qualitative methods

### Verbal protocol analysis

Also known as **"_thinking aloud protocols_"** (or **"_talking aloud
protocols_"**). Verbal protocol analysis, involves collecting and analysing
verbal data on cognitive processing.

A typical setup might involve participants being given a task (usually a task
that involves multiple steps that are chained together). They are asked to
verbalise (speak aloud) what they are thinking as they go about solving the
task. Finally, the data (i.e., recordings of what the participant said) are
coded and analysed to infer the information processing steps involved in
solving the problem. Consequently, verbal protocol analysis can carry **certain
assumptions** about the nature of human cognition/thinking---for example, that
it involves _information processing in discrete sequential steps_. For an
example for verbal protocol analysis, see @tbl-vpa.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Example Verbal Protocol Analysis
#| label: tbl-vpa
#| echo: false
#| messages: false
readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "vpa_example.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Although it might be common to associate qualitative methods with subfields of
psychology like social psychology and quantitative methods with subfields like
cognitive psychology, the qualitative--quantitative division does not map onto
subfields this easily. Verbal protocol analysis is one example of a
_qualitative_ approach that can a long history is cognitive psychology. The
approach was used in early _cognitive science_ by _Simon_ and _Newell_ who were
pioneering researchers in _Cognitive Science_ and _Artificial Intelligence_.



### Ethnography

More a **style of research** than a **method of data collection**, ethnography
involves studying people in "the field" (i.e., their naturally occurring
setting), and requires the researcher to **enter into the setting they are
studying**

- Attempts to understand how the socio-cultural practices and behaviours of
  people are shaped by their social, physical, and cultural contexts

- Tries to make sense of events from the perspective of their participants

- Could include data from _interviews_, or _participant observation_^[In
  _auto-ethnography_, researchers engage in self-reflection and treat themselves
  as the participant.]



In **cognitive psychology**, ethnographic approaches have been used to
understand how people solve problems in **real-world settings**.

For example, how do **technological artefacts** (that is, the _context_) to
support cognitive processing^[One famous study in cognitive ethnography involves
studying how sailors use the technological artefacts (instruments etc) and
layout of a ship to help them navigate]

In **critical psychology**, ethnographic approaches have been used to understand
the interplay between, **race**, **class**, **gender**, and **education** in
shaping participants' **life worlds**.



### Discourse analysis

Discourse analysis is the _social_ study of language as used in **talk**,
**text**, and **other forms of communication**.

It involves a distinctive way of thinking about talk and text where language
doesn't just **represent** the world but also **constructs** the world.

Some questions one might examine with this approach:

- How does language shape social relations? For example, how might certain kinds
  of talk establish professional distance in doctor-patient communication?

- How might language construct or open up space for particular identities. For
  example, how might language enforce or break down the concept of binary gender?





The strengths of this approach are that it allows you to examine **how language
constructs reality.**

It can make use of primary data (interviews, talk in focus groups) or secondary
data (books, newspaper articles).

But it can be difficult to use discourse analysis to develop the same kind of
**generalisations** as you might develop with other approaches.



### Phenomenology

Particularly associated with the philosophers _Husserl_, _Merleau-Ponty_, and
_Sartre_

The phenomenological approach involves **bracketing off** any preconceived
notions we might have about a phenomenon to achieve an understanding of that
phenomenon that has not been influenced by our prior beliefs.

Phenomenology emphasises peoples first-hand experience and attempts to
**understand** and **describe** subjective experience from the participant's
point of view.





Phenomenology has been used in fields like **cognitive psychology** to
understand, for example, the nature of subjective sensory experiences, the
nature of skilled actions, and the nature of cognition itself (e.g., been used
to argue against the computational theory of mind).

A **phenomenological** approach to studying, for example, inclusive classroom
settings might try to understand **what it is like** for a student with a
disability to be in that classroom setting.

An **ethnographic** approach might look at how the classroom setting **changes
interactions** between students with and without disabilities.



### Issues in qualitative research

Unlike **quantitative methods** than might use **printed questionnaires** or
**computers** to record and measure responses, in **qualitative research**, the
**researcher is the instrument**

- important for researchers to reflect on their **values**, **assumptions**,
  **biases**, and **beliefs** to understand how these might impact the research

- the research instrument (i.e., the researcher) can change. For example, in
  _ethnographic research_, the changes in the _researchers experience_ might
  alter how they record and observe behaviours.

There are parallels to **validity** (_internal_ and _external_),
**reliability**, and **"objectivity"** in **qualitative research**^[We'll
touch on these topics today, but you'll also learn more about these concepts in
coming lectures]

These are **Credibility**, **Transferability**, **Dependability**, and
**Confirmability**





- **Credibility**: Can the data support the claims. Can be established through
  _prolonged engagement_, discussions with other researchers/participants, and
  critical self-reflection

- **Transferability**: Can the findings be transferred to similar **contexts**.
  Requires extensive, detailed, and careful descriptions of the research
  **context** (**"thick descriptions"**).

- **Dependability**: Ensuring that researchers maintain a record of changes in
  the research process or research instrument (i.e., themselves) over time.

- **Confirmability**: Concerned with ensuring that the data used to support the
  conclusions are _verifiable_.



## Quantitative methods

As the name suggests, a key aspect of **quantitative methods** is
**quantification**.

**Quantification** means putting numbers to the thing we're interested in
studying so that it can be **measured**.

The motivation behind **measuring** phenomena is that measurements are
**publicly available and verifiable** (e.g., scientists can **check** or
**verify** your measurements).

Unlike _qualitative research_ where researchers try to simultaneously study many
aspects of a single phenomenon, **quantitative research** tries to condense a
phenomenon down into a single (or a few) dimension(s).

The first step in quantitative research is often figuring out how **to
quantify** the phenomenon of interest. This involves choosing a **proxy**
(something measurable) that can **stand-in for** the phenomenon



### Operationalisation

If you're interested in **anxiety**, you have to decide how to **measure**
anxiety. You can't measure an **abstract concept** directly.

The process of choosing a **proxy** is known as **operationalisation**.

There are lots of ways to choose a **measurable** proxy that can stand in for
**anxiety**.

1. Develop a **scale** or a **questionnaire**.

2. Measure **physiological responses** like _increased heart rate_ or _galvanic
   skin response_.





Measurements have to be **reliable** (reproducible) and **valid** (actually
measure what you think you're measuring).

For example, if we develop a scale for **depression** then the scale must
produce similar numbers when applied to the same person or to different people
who are similarly depressed.

A treatment for depression, should not just **reduce scores** on our depression
scale, but it must also **result in people experiencing less depression**.



### Quantitative methods and causation

Unlike **qualitative** research, which studies phenomena _in the wild_,
**quantitative** approaches try to exert a lot of **control** over phenomena.

**Control** allows researchers to make claims about **causation** and give
**causal explanations**.

There are a few ways to understand **causation**, and thinking about what
**causation** means will help us to think through ways to examine, study, or
identify it:



#### What is a cause?

One view of **causation** can be summed up _as a **difference** that makes a
**difference**_:

If you take two situations, one in which the phenomenon occurs and another in
which does not occur then whatever is different between those situations is the
**cause** of the phenomenon.

For example, take one situation in which a _window is broken_ and another in
which a _window isn't broken_. If the only difference between the two is that in
one _a boy has thrown a rock_ and in the other _a boy has not thrown a rock_
then **a boy throwing a rock** is the **cause** of the **broken window.**





You can also understand causation _in terms of **manipulation**_:

If you can manipulate one thing and observe a change in another, then the two
things may be **causally connected**.

For example, as I _put my foot down or lift it from the accelerator pedal in a
car_ I can observe _a change in the speed of the car_, so I know the
**accelerator pedal** and the **speed of the car** are **causally connected**.
By intervening and manipulating parts of **a system** you can identify how they
work (you can identify **mechanisms**).





Causation can also be understood _in terms of **probability**_:

If the presence of one thing increases the probability of the other thing
occurring, then there **may** be a **causal relationship**.

For example, the presence of _smoking_ increases the probability of _developing
cancer_, so _smoking_ **may** be the **cause** of _cancer_.



### Causation and confounds

In the examples above they are all examples of **possible** _causes_

To be justified in claiming a causal relationship **other conditions must
usually be met**.

And causal claims are not always [black]{.red} and [white]{.green}. Sometimes we
can only be more or less sure about causal relationships.

[**What are some of the other conditions that need to be met?**]{.center-x}



An example of Smoking and Cancer

- The presence of _smoking_ increases the probability of _developing cancer_, so
  _smoking_ **may** be the **cause** of _cancer_.

- _Having emphysema_ also increases the probability of _developing cancer_. But
  is _emphysema_ the **cause** of _cancer_?

There is a **plausible mechanism of action between** _smoking_ and _cancer_ but
not between _emphysema_ and _cancer_, so we can be more sure that _smoking_
**causes** _cancer_ than we can be about _emphysema_ **causing** _cancer_.

A more likely explanation is that _emphysema_ and _cancer_ have a **common
cause**—_smoking_.





Let's say you are studying the relationship between _emphysema_ and _cancer_,
because you think _emphysema_ might cause _cancer_

In this situation, _smoking_ is a **confound**

If you wanted to see whether _emphysema_ caused _cancer_ then you'd have to
**control for smoking**

- Only look at smokers and see if there's still a relationship between emphysema
  and cancer or whether cancer also occurs in the absence of emphysema

- Only look at non-smokers and see whether emphysema and cancer are still
  related or whether cancer develops in the absence of emphysema

Emphysema and cancer are **correlated** (the increase in one leads to an
increase in the other), but emphysema doesn't cause cancer because they have a
common cause. Sometimes two correlated variables have a causal relationship,
such as the correlation between smoking and cancer. Sometimes they have a common
cause---such as the correlation between developing emphysema and cancer. And
sometimes, they have neither. For example, the correlation between the number of
men getting engineering degrees and per capita consumption of sour cream (see
@fig-cream).

## Qualitative vs Quantitative methods

In qualitative research, you study phenomena **in context** while in
quantitative research you aim for **control**.

But you can use either approach to study the same phenomena/psychological
processes. Let's say you're interested in **memory**:

How could you study **memory** from

- A **qualitative** perspective?

- A **quantitative** perspective?


**Quantitative:**

You could use experiments in a lab where you give people lists of words to
remember. You could _manipulate_ aspects of the words— for example, their
**emotional salience**—and measure performance (accuracy scores) to try to
understand something about **memory** and **emotional salience**.

Ensure that the only thing that differs between the words on each list is the
**emotional salience**. Control for possible **confounds** like:

- **Word length**: make sure that one list doesn't contain long words and the
  other short words

- **Word order**: make sure some people get the lists in one order and some in the
  other order, because maybe people get tired by the end and that influences
  memory.


**Qualitative:**

For a **qualitative** approach you don't want to study memory in the lab—you
want to study it in the wild. This allows you to **ask different kinds of
questions**.

You could use an _ethnographic_ approach with, for example, bartenders. You
might do fieldwork in a bar **observing** bartenders. Through this, you might
see that bartenders **structure their environment** in a particular way—e.g.,
put certain types of glasses or bottles in particular places.





This might lead you to form the hypothesis that bartenders **structure their
environment** to support their memory—i.e., placing certain bottles and glasses
together helps them remember what goes in what kinds of cocktails.

- Follow-up interviews or discussions with bartenders or observing the training
  of bartenders might provide further evidence for this hypothesis.

- You might also engage in bartending and critically reflect on your own
  experience to understand how this **environmental structuring** supports
  memory.



## Computer simulation and formal methods

**Qualitative** and **quantitative** methods try to understand phenomena by
studying the phenomena themselves. The **data** they use comes from the
phenomena.

In approaches like **computer simulation** and **formal/mathematical modelling**
researchers instead **generate the data**.

Researchers try to **build systems** that _replicate_ or _reproduce_ some
aspects of systems or phenomena they are studying.

- This might allow them to **gain new insights** into these systems.

- **Comparing** the behaviour of their **artificial systems** with the **natural
  system** allows researchers to test theories about the **processes** that
  produce phenomena





**Computer simulation** has been used to study a lot of different phenomena in
psychology, but here are some examples of approaches I find particularly
interesting.

**Simulation** has been used to show how **seemingly complex behaviour** can
arise from **very simple processes**.

<!-- FIXME: VISUALISATION: Boids -->


``{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","flock.jpg"))

```

Flocking behaviour in birds seems very complex, and it looks **as if** there
must be something very complex going on inside their brains.

But you can **simulate** this behaviour with only three simple rules:

1. **avoid** collisions with other birds
2. **align** direction with nearby birds
3. **approach** distant birds




```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","./boids.gif"))
```


In the lecture notes you can adjust the rules of the simulation



Conway's game of life^[You can read more about Conway's game of life at [scholarpedia page](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Game_of_Life) or play with an example in the handout]





```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-caption: An example of an oscillating pattern in the Game of Life
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","./gol.gif"))
```



Conway's Game Of Life has 4 simple rules: 

- A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on

- A live cell with < 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation)

- A live cell with > 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation)

- A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)


<!-- FIXME: VISUALISATION: Conways game of life -->

### Agent-based modelling (ABM)

Agent-based modelling takes a cue from approaches like those used to model bird
flocking and Conway's Game of Life.

In an agent-based model, the research simulates a group of 'agents'.

- The 'agents' will typically have some memory, a set of goals, and some rules.

- The memory allows them to store their current state or consequences of their
  previous actions.

- The goals usually represent some state they're trying to achieve.

- And rules govern their interactions.

By allowing these agents to interact, and by manipulating aspects of the agents
(their memory, goals, and rules) is it possible to see how social phenomena can
arise.





Agent-based modelling can be used for modelling phenomena like the spread of
misinformation through social groups:

- If you thought that **misinformation** was more likely to spread if passed on
  by particularly influential individuals (e.g., celebrities or politicians),
  then you could include these in your simulation.

- Or if you thought that misinformation was more likely to spread inside
  socially isolated groups, then you could modify your simulation to create
  socially isolated groups to test this hypothesis.

After your simulation, you could still go and check the real world to see if it
behaves like your simulation.

# Lecture 4

As I said in the [previous lecture](), the focus of this course, and most of the
undergraduate research methods courses that you will take, will be on
quantitative methods. Today will be the start of our journey of learning more
about the specifics of **study design** in _quantitative_ _research_.

As we touched on in the [previous lecture](), _quantitative research_ is all
about **measurement**. The aim of _quantitative research_ is to take a
phenomenon and condense it down into a few **variables** than can be
**measured** as _precisely_ and _reliability_ as possible. We also saw that
_quantitative research_ often made use of statistical methods, and that the aim
of _quantitative_ _research_ was often to develop **generalisations** or
**generally applicable** theories. In today's lecture, we're going to learn a
bit about how to **design** quantitative studies so that _all these things are
possible_.

## The "how" of quantitative research

The conclusions that we can draw from our research depends on how that knowledge
was generated and the research design that was used. For any piece research that
we conduct (or piece of research that we read), we need to be able to answer
several questions: 1) How do we actually test **hypotheses** appropriately? 2)
How do we **generalise** our findings? 3) How to we **quantify** seemingly
unquantifiable things? The answer to these questions lies in **research
design**.

### Research design

We can use different types of research design to answer different **research
questions** and to test different **hypotheses**.[If you're not sure what the
terms **research question** and **hypothesis** mean, then just keep them in your
mind for now. Their meanings will become clearer when we get to the
examples.]{.aside} Study designs can vary along many dimensions. For example,
study designs can differ on whether they include a **manipulation** or not. They
can differ on whether they use a **between-subjects** or **within-subjects**
measurement. And they can differ with respect to the **time frame** used for
data collection.

<!--

// this is going to need a preview slide
Some study designs that vary on these dimensions include **observational designs**
and **correlational designs**.

We'll try to examine all of these dimensions by way of
examples.
-->

#### Experimental and non-experimental designs

The key feature of **experimental designs** is that there is some form of
**manipulation**. By **manipulation**, we just mean some sort of change that is
introduced that may have some impact on the thing our study is measuring.[The
**manipulation** might be something that is intentionally introduced by the
experiment, or it might be some change that is naturally occurring. We'll see
that this will be the difference between _true experiments_ and _natural
experiments_.]{.aside}

Not all possible designs include manipulations. Designs that don't include
manipulations are known as **observational** or **correlational** designs. In
correlational designs we rely on **observed data** that are not subjected to any
**experimental manipulation**. By _observational_, we don't mean that we're
_just looking_. There is still measurement, whether this is through
questionnaires, laboratory tasks, or similar.

**Correlational** designs have several **practical** advantages over
**experimental** designs. These include the ability to collect data from far
more people than would be practical for an experimental design. And they also
allow us to study phenomena where experimental manipulations would be
_unethical_. But correlational designs also have drawbacks when compared with
experimental designs. In particular, while correlational designs can be used to
investigate **relationships** between variables, but in order to make **causal**
claims, experimental designs (whether true experiments or natural experiments)
are needed.

## An example: Ice cream and murder

In @fig-murder we can see a plot of the relationship between the murder rate and
the number of ice creams sold in New York City. We can see from the plot that
when the murder rate is high then the number of ice cream sales is also high and
when the murder rate is low then the number of ice creams sold is also low. But
are they _just correlated_ or does ice cream _cause_ murder?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: The relationship between the murder rate and ice cream sales in New York City
#| label: fig-murder
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","IC.jpg"))
```

We might design to conduct some research into this relationship between ice
cream and murder to see whether there actually is some sort of causal
relationship. Obviously, there are **many** ethical issues with conducting an
experiment on this, but let's put those aside for now and see what such an
experiment might actually look like.

Our first step in our experiment would be to specify our **research question**.
In this example, our research question might be something like: _Does eating ice
cream make you more prone to murderous tendencies?_ From this we can now
formulate our **hypothesis**. In our **hypothesis** we will actually specify the
outcome we expect. Our hypothesis might be something like: _Eating ice cream
increases the desire to commit murder_.

Testing our hypothesis with an experiment might involve something like the
following steps: First, we might invite a bunch of people into lab. Half these
people will be given some ice cream eat, and the other half will not be given
some ice cream. This is our **manipulation**. Next, we might get all of our
participants to look at several images of people (our _stimuli_) while we get to
rate how much they want to **eliminate** them on a scale of 0 (no desire) to 9
(all the desire possible).

In this study, we have **independent variable** (IV) or _predictor variable_.
This is the thing that we're manipulating. In our case, this is whether people
ate ice cream or not. We manipulated our IV by assigning people to one of **two
groups**: The _ice cream condition_ or the _no ice cream condition_. We also
have one **dependent variable** (DV) or _outcome variable_. In our case, this
would be participants total score on our _desire to eliminate_ measure.

After we have all our data we could then compare the results between the _ice
cream **condition**_ and the _no ice cream **condition**_ to see which group
gave higher ratings for their _desire to eliminate people_ (the **outcome** or
**DV**).

## Features of good study design

Our study on the relationship between murder and ice cream is an example of a
very unethical study, but it is also a _poorly_ designed study. In a
well-designed experiment, we can be confident in saying our **manipulation**
_caused_ a change in our **outcome variable**. But this isn't the case for our
ice-cream study. Let's take a look at some features of good study design.

### Controls

Our imaginary study didn't use _any_ **controls**. We recruited all kinds of
people without giving consideration to how different characteristics might
affect our results. Let's say, for example, that all the people that we
recruited were actually lactose intolerant and that for these people eating
ice-cream caused a great deal of discomfort. Perhaps it is actually this
discomfort that caused their murderous rage and their murderous rage is not
specific to ice cream _per se_. It could equally well be caused by drinking
milkshakes.

We might also not have had a standardised set of instructions that we gave to
participants. Some participants might have arrived very hungry and other
participants might have arrived very full. Maybe the differences that we observe
are actually a result of some participants being very
[hangry](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hangry).

Maybe we didn't control our **IV** appropriately. We might have often changed
the brand or the flavour of the ice cream. Some days we might have run out of
ice cream and used _frozen yoghurt_ instead. And some days we might just have
given a small amount of ice-cream and other days we might have forced our
participants to eat a large amount of ice cream. Now we wouldn't know exactly
what cause any changes in our **outcome**.

We might also not have controlled the lab environment adequately. On some days
the heating might have been up really high. And other days the air-conditioning
might have been up really high. Maybe it's just the heat that's driving people
into a murderous rage?

### Randomisation

Another feature that might have been missing from our study is that we didn't
**randomly assign** people to groups: Maybe we did our participant recruitment
first at a dentist's office and then at supermarket. And maybe all participants
recruited first were assigned to the ice cream condition with the second batch
of participants assigned to the no ice cream condition. Because of this, it
might so happen to be the case that all the participants in the ice cream
condition just so happened to have sensitive teeth. This would affect the
results by giving us the impression that ice cream increases murderous
tendencies when it doesn't. To deal with these issues, participants should have
been sorted into groups **randomly**. A well-designed experiment would randomise
the **participant allocation** and the **stimulus presentation order** (in our
experiment, this refers to the order in which the images of faces were rated).

### Blinding

In our study, we might have told participants that we were interested in the
effect of ice cream on murderous tendencies. And we might have also given
participants the ice cream ourselves. Participants may have (consciously or not)
modified their behaviour to either fit the hypothesis or to contradict the
hypothesis. Because of this, it is crucial that participants are unaware of what
the hypothesis was and also what condition they have been allocated to. If
participants are naïve to group allocation then study is said to be
**single-blind**. If neither the participants nor the researcher know which
condition the participants are put in, then the study design is known as
**double-blind**. In such a case allocation might be recorded but only revealed
once the study is over and the data are being analysed.

### Theoretical framework

The choice of **predictor** (**IV**) and **outcome** (**DV**) variables does not
happen in a theoretical vacuum. Rather, these choices are based on theory. In
our experiment, the decision to have ice cream as the **IV** and murderous
tendencies as the **DV** was not based on any **theory**. It could be that
committing murder causes people to eat ice cream. In which case, we should
probably have swapped around our IV and DV. Or it might be that they're
completely unrelated. To have good reasons for running the experiment we did,
we'd would probably have to be able to tell some kind of a plausible story about
**how** eating ice cream a murder were related. Such a story would probably have
to make reference to some kind of psychologically or biologically plausible
mechanism that might explain the connection.

## Types of study designs

We've already talked about experimental designs through your example. But it's
worth spending a little more time talking about different kinds of study design.

### Experimental studies

First, we have **experimental studies**. Experimental studies usually have tight
controls. As a result, experimental studies can be somewhat artificial, because
they abstract away from reality. This means that experimental studies can
sometimes lack something called **ecological validity**. Ecological validity
refers to the ability to generalise the results of the study to **real-life**
settings. That is, just because something is true is the lab, doesn't
necessarily mean that it will be true in "the real world". Experimental designs
do, however, provide the most rigorous methodology for investigating **causal
relationships**.

As we saw in our example, good experimental design requires randomisation,
manipulation, and adequate controls. For many research questions there are
methodological, logistical, and ethical obstacles that make it infeasible to
conduct experiments. In these cases, we might want to use a
**quasi-experimental** design or a **natural experiment**.

### Quasi-experiments

**Quasi-experimental** designs are similar to experimental designs **expect for
participant randomisation**. As a result, they're used in situations where it's
not possible to randomise the allocation of participants into groups. An example
of a study using a **quasi-experimental** design might be one looking at the
effectiveness of attending summer school. If one school offers summer school,
but another does not, then we can't randomise students into the intervention. In
situations like this, we should still try to **match** the participants so that
the two groups don't differ on any Characteristics that might be relevant to our
outcome. Expect, of course, for the characteristic we're actually interested
in---attending summer school.

### Natural experiments

**Natural experiments** are studies where randomisation and manipulation occur
through **natural** or **socio-political** means. A good example of a **natural
experimental** might be _twin studies_. Identical twins share 100% of their
genes while fraternal twins only share on average 50% of their genes. However,
both kinds of twins tend to share the same home environment (if they're raised
together). By comparing similarities on some characteristic between identical
twins and between fraternal twins we might be able to estimate the degree of
variation of some characteristic that is due to genetic variation. Other
examples of natural experiments might be made possible by differences or changes
in government policy: For example, bans on cigarette advertising, or differences
in length on compulsory education. Natural events, or even natural disasters,
might create the manipulations that natural experiments can be based on.

## Aspects of study design

In our ice cream example, we used a between-subjects design, but this isn't the
only option available to us. We just collected our data at one point in time.
And this too isn't the only option available to us.

### With-subjects and between-subjects designs

In a **between-subjects** or **independent design** we compare different
**groups** of participants. For example, in our ice cream study, one **group**
of participants ate ice cream while the other **group** of participants did not.

Between-subjects designs can be contrasted with **within-subjects** or
**repeated measures** design. As the name suggested, this kind of design
involves _repeatedly measuring_ participants, but **under different
conditions**. We can show the distinction by way of an example. Let's say that I
conduct a study where I'm interested in whether people are better at remembering
long words or short words. A _between-subjects_ design would involve getting one
_group_ of participants to remember long words and another _group_ of
participants to remember short words. With a **within-subjects** design,
however, all participants would be asked to remember the words under both
conditions (short words and long words). We'd measure their memory for words
under both of these conditions.

With **within-subjects** designs there are some additional things than we will
need to consider. For example, if participants perform one condition first
followed by the other conditions then we might need to consider whether there
are order effects presents. It might be that participants are fatigued by the
time they get to the later condition and as a result they perform worse on it.
Or it might be the case that by the time they get to the later condition they
have already had some practise with the task and, therefore, they might perform
better.

Finally, we can mix **within-subject** manipulations with **between-subject**
manipulations. This is what is known as a **mixed-design**. To use our word
memory example above, an example of a **mixed-design** might be as follows:
First, we might split our participants in **two groups** and give one group some
special memory training. All participants would then be asked to perform the
word memory task. We could then examine whether the influence of the memory
training made a difference to whether people were better at remember short words
over long words.

### Time frame

<!-- change this header -->

In our ice cream example we also only took our measurements at one point in
time. But this too is not the only option available to us. We could for example
vary the time frame used. There are a couple of different ways in which we could
do this. First, in a **cross-sectional** design, we're still taking our
measurements at a single point in time

An alternative to a _cross-sectional_ design might be a **longitudinal design**.
This kind of design involves repeated measurement of the same characteristic of
the same participants at multiple different time points. The logistics involves
in **Longitudinal designs** can make them very difficult to carry out. This is
particularly true where studies carry on for several decades. This can also make
them very time-consuming and expensive to carry out. Finally, the risk of
**missing data** with longitudinal studies can also be very high.

### Missing data

Missing data can occur in all types of studies, not just longitudinal studies,
although the large-scale nature of them does make it more likely. Missing values
can also result from a number of different causes. For example, they might be a
result of technical failures (such a computer errors) that means answers don't
get registered or recorded properly. They might also occur because participants
accidentally skip questions. Or they might occur because participants
intentionally skip questions because they don't want to disclose some bit of
information---for example, information that might be of a sensitive nature.

The presence and pattern of missing data can sometimes be random, but sometimes
it is not. For example, you might have a survey that includes questions about
income, because you're interested in some relationship between income and some
characteristic. It might be the case that the missing data that you observe is a
result of one specific group of participants, for example, those from a low SES
background, skipping over those questions. By exploring the pattern and possible
causes of missing responses we can learn more about our data.

## Measurement

### Construct validity

A measure is **valid** if it measures what it is supposed to measure. In
psychology, we often want to measure things that maybe be difficult to observe
directly and difficult to **quantify**. For example, things like happiness, or
cognitive ability, or personality. We attempt to measure these unobservable
things using a range of different tools including questionnaires or experimental
tasks. We design these tools by using the theoretical underpinnings behind the
constructs we are trying to measure. **Construct validity** is the extent to
which a tool can be justifiably trusted to actually measure the construct it is
supposed to measure.

### External validity

A study has **external validity** if its findings can be applied to the entire
population of people with the relevant characteristics. For example, if study
uses a sample of white women in western cultures, the findings may only be true
for white women in western cultures. They might not apply or **generalise** to
_all_ people.

We've already touched on **ecological validity**. **Ecological validity**, which
is often an issue in experiments, refers to whether the findings of a study
apply to the "_real world_". Just because something is true in the lab doesn't
mean it is going to be true in the real world.

### Reliability

Finally, **reliability** refers to the **consistency** of a measure. A measure
is **reliable** if it produces consistent results each time it's used by the
same participant. For example, we could measure someone's maths anxiety with
a questionnaire. Our questionnaire would be considered **reliable** if when we
tested the same participant on different occasions they got similar scores each
time. This stability over time is known as **test-retest reliability**.

```

In [Lecture 4](/lectures/week04/handout) we started talking about how
quantitative methods deal with **measurement**---that is, putting numbers to
things. In today's lecture we're going to start talking about what we actually
do with these numbers, and how to make a little more sense of measurements in
general. This lecture will be the first in a set of lectures where we'll talk
about **samples** and **populations**, how to **describe** them, and how to
understand the relationship between them. A lot of these ideas are
interconnected, so we'll be touching on some ideas multiple times. But
hopefully each time we'll be able to gain a richer understanding.

The first thing we'll want to do when we've collected a set of measurements is
to describe them in some way. One way to do this is to work out what the
**typical value** is. And it's this kind of description that we'll turn our
attention to first. We'll start off by looking at three different ways we can
describe the **typical value** is a set of numbers. 

## Measures of central tendency

What we mean by the **typical value** is not always clear. For example, in
@fig-income we can see the average annual salary (in US dollars) for a set of
`r dim(salary)[1]` countries. Each bar of the plot represents the number of
countries in the given salary bracket ($0--$10k, $10-$20k, ...).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig.align: center
#| fig.height: 3
#| label: fig-income
#| fig.cap: "National average annual salary [source: https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php]"
(salary |> ggplot(aes(x = yearly)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1e4, boundary = 0, fill = "white", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Annual salary in USD", y = "Count")) |>
  plotly::ggplotly(tooltip = "count") |>
  plotly::config(displayModeBar = F)
```


From the plot we can see that there are a lot of countries where the average
annual salary is less than $30,000 USD. There are also a handful of countries
where the average annual salary is more than $100,000 USD. What would you
consider the _most typical_ annual salary? The bracket with the most countries
in it? If so, that would mean the most typical salary on the planet is between
$0 and $10,000 USD per year. Or maybe we should pick the value where half the
countries have a lower average salary and half the countries have a higher one?
Choosing this option leads to an estimate of the most typical salary of
`r salary$yearly |> median() |> USD()` per year.

As you can see, depending on how we define _the most typical value_, we get
different answers. We'll cover the three main ways of defining the _typical
value_ or _average_. Together, these ways of describing the _typical_ or
_average_ value are known as **measures of central tendency**.

### Mode

The **mode** is a term that refers to the **most frequent value** in a set of
measurements. This is the kind of _average_ we discussed above when we said the
most typical salary on the planet is between $0 and $10,000 USD a year. The
easiest way to spot the **mode** is just to draw a plot like the one we did in
@fig-income and then just look for the tallest bar.

A set of numbers can have one or more modes. If it only has one mode, then it is
said to be **unimodal**. **Bimodal** means it has two modes. If it has three or
more modes, then it is usually called **multimodal**. Some examples of
this are shown in @fig-diff-modes.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-diff-modes
#| fig-cap: Datasets with different numbers of modes.
#| fig-subcap:
#|    - "A unimodal dataset"
#|    - "A bimodal dataset"

require(dplyr)

# Let's draw some plots

tibble(x = rchisq(n = 10000, df = 5, ncp = 0)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, boundary = 0, col = "grey20", fill = "grey80") +
  theme_cowplot() +
  labs(x = "value", y = "count")

# Bimodal
set.seed(123)
d <- rnorm(n = 5000, mean = 2, 1)
tibble(x = c(
  d,
  d + 3
)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, boundary = 0, col = "grey20", fill = "grey80") +
theme_cowplot() +
labs(x = "value", y = "count")

# Multimodal
d <- rep(seq(0, 5, length.out = 100), times = 100)
tibble(x = d) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 11, boundary = 0, col = "grey20", fill = "grey80") +
theme_cowplot() +
labs(x = "value", y = "count")
```


:::{.callout-important}

The mode is the only definition of _typical value_ that works for data that is
measured at the **nominal**/**categorical** level.

When it comes to truly **continuous** variables, such as height, the mode is
often not very informative. Why? Because no two people are **exactly** the same
height (right down to the exact same number of nanometres), so each value in the
dataset may be unique. For this reason, the mode is rarely used for continuous
variables measured at the **interval** or **ratio** levels.

Average salary is continuous variable, but we turned it into a discrete variable
placing chunking the measurements into discrete bins. 

:::

### Median

```{r}
#| echo: false
dice_res <- c(3, 4, 6, 1, 1) 

```

The **median** is the second kind of average we talked about
[above](#measures-of-central-tendency); the
middle value where half the measurements are above that value and half the
measurements are below. To find the median, we first need to sort our data.
Let's say we roll a 6-sided dice 5 times and get the following: 
`r paste0(dice_res[1:4], collapse = ", ")` and `r dice_res[5]`.

To calculate the median, let's do the two steps:

1. Sort the data from smallest or largest: `r sort(dice_res)`

2. Find the mid-point: We have five observations so the third one in the
sorted sequence is the mid-point.

So out of five rolls the median is `r median(dice_res)` (and the mode is 1). If
we had an even number of observations then the median would be the half-way
point between the two mid-point values. For example, if we instead rolled the
dice 6 times and got the results 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, and 6 then the median would be
the midpoint between 3 and 4, or `r median(c(1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6))`.

@fig-sorted below shows the annual salary in USD per each of the countries in the
data set, sorted from lowest to highest. Notice, that this time, we’re not
grouping countries in salary brackets and looking at how many there are in each
one as was the case in @fig-income. Here, each bar represents a country.

Because we have an even numbers of countries in our dataset (78), there are two
mid-points. These are highlighted in orange in the plot below. To get the median
annual national salary, we need to find the value half-way between the average
salary in Romania and Venezuela, which in this data set turns out to be 
`r median(salary$yearly) |> USD()`.

To be able to calculate a meaningful median, the variable must be measured on
**at least the ordinal level**.

### Mean

The arithmetic mean is what most people mean when they talk about the
*average*. You can work the mean of a set of numbers by adding up all
the values and then dividing this by the number of values in the data
set. Mathematically, you can represent this with the formula shown
in @eq-mean, below:

```{r}
#| echo: false
rgb2 <- \(red, green, blue) rgb(red, green, blue, maxColorValue = 255)
hex <- function(x) {
  stringr::str_split(x, ",")[[1]] |>
  as.numeric() |>
  setNames(c(
    "red",
    "green", "blue"
  )) |>
  as.list() |>
  do.call("rgb2", args = _)
}
mean_c <- "255, 0, 0"
sum_c <- "0, 255, 0"
all_c <- "0, 0, 255"
div_c <- "255, 0, 255"
```


$$
\definecolor{sum}{RGB}{`r sum_c`}
\definecolor{n}{RGB}{`r all_c`}
\definecolor{i}{RGB}{`r all_c`}
\definecolor{x}{RGB}{`r all_c`}
\definecolor{div}{RGB}{`r div_c`}
\definecolor{mean}{RGB}{`r mean_c`}
{\color{mean}\bar{x}}={\color{div}\frac{1}{N}}{{\color{sum}\sum^{\color{n}N}_{\color{i}i=1}}{\color{x}x_i}}
$$ {#eq-mean}

Take <font color="`r hex(mean_c)`">mean of the data</font> is equal to
<font color="`r hex(sum_c)`">the sum</font> of
<font color="`r hex(all_c)`">all the values</font>
<font color="`r hex(div_c)`">divided by the number of values</font>

<!-- TODO: Break down the sum notation a bit more -->

### Mean vs Median

Both of these measures have their advantages and disadvantages. The mean is
easier to worth with from a mathematical point of view. And for this reason,
most of the statistical methods we'll be learning about are based on the mean.

Compared to other measures of central tendency, *means taken from different
samples of the same population* tend to be **more similar to each other**. If,
on the other hand, we calculated medians for different samples from the same
population, there would be more variability in the values we'd obtain. Turning
back to our dice example: If we took the median and the mean of 5 dice rolls,
and we did this over and over, the mean values would be more bunched around 3.5
with very few values less than 2. The median values would still be be centred
around 3.5, but we'd get more values less than 2, so they would be more spread
out.[This is related to the idea of the **sampling distribution**, which we'll
cover in [Lecture 8](/lectures/week08/handout).]{.aside}

However, there are also some downsides to the **mean** relative to the
**median**. The primary one is that the _mean_ is **sensitive to extreme
values** in a way that the _median_ is not. This means that, even if we have a
really big sample size, adding a **single value** that is extremely big or
extremely small can shift the _mean_ dramatically. This is not the case for
the _median_.

```{r}
#| echo: false

d1 <- c(5, 3, 1, 7, 10, 4, 5)
n_v <- 1000
d2 <- c(d1, n_v)
```


For example, let's say we have a list of numbers: `r d1`. This list of numbers
has a median of `r median(d1)` and a mean of `r mean(d1)`. If we add an
additional value of `r n_v` to this list, then our new median would be unchanged
at `r median(d2)`, but our new mean would be `r mean(d2)`.

<!-- FIXME: Add visualisation of mean and median -->

## Sample means and population means

So far we've just been talking about describing the typical value in a set of
measurements that we have---our **sample**. But one of the key things that we
want to do with *statistics* is to make **inferences** about **populations**
from *the information* that we get from **samples**. That is, we often want to
make a judgement, or draw a conclusion, about an aspect of the population when
all we have access to is a sample.

We'll get to more formal definitions of _populations_ and _samples_ shortly, but
first, let's make things more concrete by introducing an example.

Let's say you're interested in the **average height** of **people in the UK**.
The "easy" way to find an answer to this question is to measure **all the people
in the UK** and then work out the **average height**. Doing this will give you
the exact answer to your question. But if you can't measure everyone in the UK,
then what do you do?

One option is to select a smaller group, or subset, of people from the UK. You
can then measure the height of people in this group, and then try to use this
information to figure out plausible values for the average height of people in
the UK.

In this example, the group (or groups) you're making claims about is the
population. You want to claims about **the average height** of **people in the
UK**. And the **sample** is a subset of this population---the smaller group of
people that you were eventually able to measure.

It's important to note that there isn't a **single** population. What counts as
the population will depend on the claim you're making. For example, let's say
I'm interested in testing the claim, "Do **people in East Sussex** show an
interference effect on the Stroop task?". Here the **population** would be
**people in East Sussex**. If, however, I want to make claims about **people in
general**, then the **population** might be all **living** humans.

### Theoretical populations

So far in our talk of populations we've only really be thinking about
populations as the **set of actually existing things** that we can take our
sample from---for example, all **living** humans. But populations don't have to
be sets of actually existing things. Instead, they can be the **set of possible
things** from which our samples can be drawn. This might seem a little
confusing, so an example might help.

Let's say we want to collect a sample of 6 coin flips. To collect our
**sample**, we take a coin and _flip it 6 times_ and count up the number of
heads and tails and from this we could work out, for example, how many _heads
are typically seen when flipping the coin 6 times_.

So that's our **sample**, but what is our **population**? One way to think of
our population is as the **set of possible outcomes (numbers of heads) that
would occur if we flipped the coin 6 times**. It turns out that can actually
work this out.

To work it out we would do something like the following:

<!-- do binimials -->

We can work it out because we know something about the **process that gives rise
to our data**. Although we might not be able to clearly specify the process that
gives to the data in a Stroop task, there will still be some **data generating
process**, which we can think of as the **population** we're sampling from.

:::{.callout-note}

In later years you'll learn about something called the **null hypothesis**. The
**null hypothesis**, in simple terms, says that the **data generating process**
for two sets of observations is same. For example, it might say that the _data
generating process_ that gives rises to people's responses on the Stroop task is
the same for the **congruent condition** and the **incongruent condition**.
You'll learn how to perform statistical tests that tell you whether the set of
data that you've actually collecting is **surprising** or **unsurprising** if
you were to assume that _two_ **data generating processes** are actually the
same.

:::

### The relationship between samples and populations

Let's assume that we have explicitly defined our **population** (for example, as
_all people in the UK_) and we've collected a **sample** by taking measurements
from a **subset** of this population. What is the relationship between this
sample and the population from which it was drawn?

The _sample_ should **resemble** the _population_ in some way. Most often we're
interested is knowing something like: "_What is the typical value (i.e., the
mean) of the population?"_ In the example I introduced earlier, we were
interested in **average height**. But we might also be interested in things a
difference between two averages---for example, whether there is a difference in
**average depression levels** before and after some intervention, or whether
**average response times** are different between the two conditions of a Stroop
task. Ideally then, the **average height** of our **sample** should **resemble**
the **average** height of our **population**, or the _average_ _response_ _time_
_difference_ in our **experimental sample** should _resemble_ the _average
response time difference_ in our population. But if we don't know the
**average** of our **population**, then how will we know whether our **sample**
_resembles_ it?

Let's say that adults in the UK are between 78cm and 231cm but that the average
height of an adult in the UK 170cm. So our population average is 170cm. Now
let's collect a sample of data. We'll talk more about the influence of sample
size in [Lecture ](). But for now let's just say that we collect a sample of 50
people. And let's say that we don't only collect one sample, but that we collect
a sample of 50 over and over again. Below you can see the average height of our
sample of 50 people, with a solid line showing the population mean.

What do you notice? The sample means don't always line up exactly with the
population mean. Sometimes the sample mean is higher and sometimes the sample
mean is lower. It moves around a bit from sample to sample. Because it moves
around, and because we don't know the population mean, this tells us that **on
any particular sample** we won't know whether the sample mean is the same as the
population mean.

### The average of the sample means

But let's think of things from a slightly different perspective. Let's treat
the mean of each sample of 50 people as a measurement. We'll now take a
**"sample"** of these measurements. That is, we'll take we'll measurement 50
people and work out the average height, then measure another people people and
work out the average height, and then another 50 people, and so on. And each of
these averages of 50 people will be one measurements. We'll just add these
measurements to our **sample of samples**, and each time get add a new
measurement we'll work out the average of this **sample of samples**. We can see
was happens to this average in the animation below. What do you notice?

<!-- FIXME: Aniimatio -->

That's right, as we carry on collecting more and more **samples of samples** the
average of theses will eventually line up and match the **population mean**.
What can we conclude from this?

This tells us that even though we don't know whether the mean of **any
particular sample** is the same as the population mean, the **sample mean** will
**on average** be the same as the population mean. We'll touch of this idea more
in future lectures when we talk about the **sampling distribution**, but for now
this simple idea is all you need to know. 

## Measures of spread

So far we've only been talk about the **typical** value, or the **central**
value, of a set data. But if you look at at @fig-hist-width you'll see two data
sets that are centred at the same value but have very different amounts of
variability. Both sets of data have a mean of 0. But, as you can see, the values
of one are spread out much more widely than the values of the other.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-hist-width
#| fig-cap: Histogram of two distributions with equal means but different spreads. *N = 10,000* in each case.
dist_narrow <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
dist_wide <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 3)
tibble::tibble(
  narrrow = dist_narrow,
  wide = dist_wide
) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(1:2) |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(
    x = value,
    # group = name,
    fill = name,
    alpha = name
  )) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", position = "identity") +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(1, 0.7), guide = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("seagreen", "blue"), guide = "none") +
  NULL
```


This is why, in addition to measures of central tendency, we also need measures
that tell us about the spread, or _dispersion_ of a variable. Once again, there
are several measures of spread available, and we'll talk about five of them:

1. Range

2. Interquartile range

3. Deviation

4. Variance

5. Standard deviation

<!-- FIXME: Add the visualisation in here? -->


### Range

The **range** of a variable is simply the distance between its smallest and
largest values. For example, if we gather a sample of 100 participants and the
youngest one is 17 years old, and the oldest one is 67 years old, then the range
of our age variable in this sample if 67 - 15 = `r 67 - 17` years.

Checking the range of a variable can tell us something about whether our data
makes sense. Let's say that we've run a study examining reading ability in
primary school age children. In this study, we've also measured the ages of the
children. If the range of our age variable is, for example, 50 years, then that
tells us that we've measured _at least_ one person that is not school age.

Beyond that, the range doesn't tell us much of the information we'd usually like
to know. This is because the range is _extremely_ **sensitive to outliers**.
What this means is that it only takes one extreme value to inflate the range. In
our school example, it might be that all but one of the people measured is
actually in the correct age range. But the range alone cannot tell us if this is
the case.

### Interquartile range

A slightly more useful measure than the range is the **interquartile range** or
IQR. The IQR is the distance between the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the data.
Quartiles, like the name suggests, are created by splitting the data into four
chunks where each chunk has the same number of observations. Or put another way,
the median splits the data into two where half the observations are higher than
the median and half the observations are lower than the median. Quartiles are
created by taking each of these halves and splitting them in half again. The
range covered by the middle two 25% chunks is the IQR. It is the range that
covers the middle 50% of the data.

The benefit of the IQR over a simple range is that the IQR is not sensitive to
occasional extreme values. This is because the bottom 25% and the top 25% are
discarded. However, by discarding these data, the IQR provides no information
about how spread these outer areas are.

Both the range and the IQR work by looking at the distance between only two
observations in the entire data. For the range, it's the distance between the
minimum point and the maximum. For the IQR, it's the distance between the
midpoint of the upper half and the midpoint of the lower half. To get a more
fine-grained idea of the spread, we'll need a new way of measuring it. 

But that is where we'll leave it for now, and we'll pick our story back up in
the next lecture.



# Lecture 7


Last week we started talking about describing measurements, and the relationship
between samples and populations. We covered measures of central tendency, and we
started talking about measures of spread. Specifically, we covered the **range**
and the **interquartile range** (IQR).

Both the range and the IQR work by looking at the distance between only two
observations in the entire data. For the range, it's the distance between the
minimum point and the maximum. For the IQR, it's the distance between the
midpoint of the upper half and the midpoint of the lower half. To get a more
fine-grained idea of the spread, we'll need a new way of measuring it. And this
is where we turn our attention to next.

## Variance and standard deviation

To get a more fine-grained measure of the spread we could look at each data
point and calculate how far it is away from some reference point. This reference
point is usually the mean. We look at how we do this for a population first,
before turning our attention to samples, and then relationship between samples
and populations.

### Population variance

Let's say that we've measured every member of some finite population.
We're going to define a new measure which we're going to call the **deviation**,
which is just going to be the difference between each individual in the
population and the population mean. We can represent this mathematically with
eq-pop-dev, below:


<!-- FIXME: Add equation -->

Because we are calculating this for every data point there will be as many
deviations as we have values for our variable. To get a _single measure_, we'll
have to perform another step.

One thing we could try doing is just to add up the numbers. But this won't work.
To see why, try adding a few points below. Add you add the points take a look at
the table below. The table has a column with all the points, and all the
deviations from the mean. Below the table you can see what happens when you add
up all those deviation values. What do you notice?

As you can see, they add up to zero. Because the mean is our midpoint, the
distances for all the points higher than the mean cancel out the distances for
all the points lower than the mean.

We can get around this problem by taking the square of the deviations before
adding them up. Squaring a number will turn a negative number into a positive
number, so when we add up all the numbers they'll no longer add up to 0.

Adding up all the numbers, however, leaves us with another problem. The sum of
the squared deviations gets bigger with bigger samples. That's not good because
even big samples can have a small amount of variation, while smaller samples can
vary a lot. So instead of simply adding up all the deviations, we'll instead
work out what the **typical** squared deviation is by working out the **average**.

The **average** or **mean squared deviation** is called the **variance**. Using
this instead of the sum of the deviations gets around the problem of the measure
of spread just getting bigger when we have bigger datasets. 

To work out the **average squared deviation** or **variance** we would just
divide the sum of the squared deviations by the size of our population. This is
represented mathematically in #eq-variance, below:

### Sample variance

So far we've just talked about working out the **variance** of some population.
This involved measuring the entire population. But as with our earlier
discussion about sample means and population means, we usually don't have access
to the entire population. And, we touched on in our discussion of "theoretical
populations", we're often not dealing with populations were it's even possible
to measure every member. Instead, we have to work with **samples**.

How do we work out the **variance** for a sample? Well one options would be to
do the same thing we do when we work out the **variance** of the **population**.
Doing so would mean we'd first work out all the deviations between each one of
our sample points and the population mean, and we'd then work out the average.
But how do we do this if we don't know the **population mean**? Well this is
where things get tricky. 

#### Properties of a good estimate

When we talked about **means** we saw that each individual sample mean might not
have been equal to the population mean but that, *on average* the sample mean
(the mean of our sample of samples) was equal to the population. This is a good
thing. We want measurements we take from samples to resemble the population,
even if it's only *on average*. Does the same same hold true for **variance**?

Well, we can give it a try using a simulation. Let's say that I have some
population that I know the properties of. We'll say that our population has a
mean of 100 and a variance of `r 15^2`. But you don't know this mean and
variance, so you'll have to take a sample from the population instead. Let's say
that you'll take a sample of exactly 50 people. 

<!-- NOTE: Again, we'll talk more about the influence of sample size later -->

You use this sample of 50 people to work out the variance using the equation
above, but because you don't know the value of the population mean you use the
sample mean instead. Below you can see what happens when you work out the
variance over and over. What do you notice?

You can see that the variance moves around from sample to sample. Sometimes it
is larger than the population variance and sometimes it is smaller than the
population variance. This is the same thing we saw with the sample mean. So the
variances from individual samples don't match the population variance. But are
they the same, _on average_. Below you can see what happens when we work out the
**average variance** over many samples. What do you notice?

That's right, unlike with the **mean**, the variance that we've worked out from
our sample doesn't eventually settle to match the **population variance**. It
underestimates it!

### The sample variance

How can we fix this? Maybe if I tell you the **population mean** and you work
out the variance using the **population mean** instead then that would work
better. Below we can see what happens when you try that. What do you notice?


That's right, the variance you've calculated from the sample now _on average_
lines up with the **population variance**. Unfortunately, being in a situation
where you know the population mean is unlikely, but seeing how this bit of
information made a difference does tell us something useful Unfortunately, being
in a situation where you know the population mean is unlikely, but seeing how
this bit of information made a difference does tell us something useful. It
tells us that the bias is related to how much the **sample mean** bounces around
from sample to sample. We'll learn how to estimate this in a later lecture, but
for now we just need to know how to correct for this bias.

To correct for this bias we can just make a slight adjustment to our we compute
the variance when we're dealing with a **sample**. This correction to to divide
the sum of our squared deviations by _N - 1_ instead of _N_. We'll call this
quantity the **sample variance**, because we calculate it from _a sample_. Below
we can see what happens when we do this. What do you notice?

That's right, after adding many samples, our **sample variance** eventually
lines up with the variance of our **population**. From this, we can say that
**the sample variance** provides an **unbiased estimate of the variance of the
population**.

### The standard deviation

Variance is a good measure of dispersion and it is widely used. However, there
is one downside to variance, and that is that it can be difficult to interpret:
it's measured in _squared units_. For example, going back to our Salary example
from [Lecture 6](), if salary is measured in USD, the **variance** would be
expressed in USD^2^, whatever that means!

Fortunately, the solution to this problem is easy: we simply take the square
root of the variance. This measure is called the **standard deviation**. Just
like with variance, there is a **population** standard deviation, denoted with
$\sigma$. And a **sample** standard deviation, denoted with $s$ or $SD$.

<!-- TODO: Maybe add the calculations -->

:::{.callout-note} 

You can think of _SD_ as a measure of the differences of a set of scores from
their mean. If variance is the mean _squared_ deviation in the variable,
standard deviation is the **mean deviation**.

:::

## Understanding the relationship between samples and populations

Now that we have some mathematical tools for describing measurements, both in
terms of where they are centred (the _mean_) and in terms of how spread out they
are (the _standard deviation_). With these tools in hand, we can now dig into
the relationship between samples and populations in a bit more detail.

In the previous lecture we started talking about the problem of knowing whether
our sample **resembles** our population. For example, if we really want to know
what the mean of the population is, but all we have is the sample mean, so we
might want to have some way of knowing whether these two values are similar.

We said that we could never know whether any particular sample mean was the same
as the population mean, but that _on average_ they would be the same. This is
because the same mean varies from sample to sample, and the population mean is
some fixed and unknown value.

Although **we can't know for sure** whether a particular sample mean resembles
the population mean, we might be able to think of some things that **influence**
the relationship between our **sample** and the **population**. To figure out
what these are, let's do a thought experiment and think of some **extreme
cases**.

First, consider the case where **all the members** of a _population_ are
**identical**. If this were the case, then our **sample** will have an
**identical** average to the population. The height of one person would be the
same as the average height of two people, which would be the same as the average
height of 100 people, which would be same as the average height of the
population because people only come in one height. But if the **members** of the
**population** are all **different** from one another, then there is no
guarantee that the **sample's average** will **resemble** the **population's
average**.

The second extreme scenario is if our sample is **very large**. Let's say that
it is so large that it includes **all the members of the population**. If this
were the case, then, by definition, our **sample average** would be
**identical** to the **population average**. However, if our sample is smaller
than the entire population, then once again, there is no guarantee that the
**sample's average** will **resemble** the **population's average**.

Based on this reasoning, we can say that two things will influence whether your
_sample_ resembles your _population_. These are 1) the amount of **variation**
in our population, and 2) the **size** of our sample.

Importantly, however, and barring the extreme cases above, for **any particular
sample** we won't know whether it **resembles** the population or not, because,
remember, we don't know the average of the population. Instead, we should think
about these two factors as influencing the **average distance** between the
samples and the population. But what does this mean?

One way to think about this is in terms of **repeatedly** taking samples from
the same population. For example, if we take a large sample from the
population---large, but not so large as to include the entire population---then
we can't say that our **particular** sample will resemble the population. But if
we take many samples (of that size), then we can say that **on average** those
samples will be closer to the population than would be the case for a collection
of smaller samples.

The same reasoning applies to **variation in the population**. If there is
**less variation** in the **population**, then the samples drawn from that
population will tend to be closer to each other and closer to the population
average. But again, we won't be able to say whether **a particular sample** has
an **average** that is close to the population average.

Of course, sample size and population variation exert their influence together.
If we want our sample averages to be close to the population average, then we
need samples that are **big enough**, but what counts as **big enough** will
depend on the **population variation**. 

To make this concrete, we'll take a look at an example.

<!-- FIXME: Tidy up and add things: Explore more about sample -->

The 20-sided dice represents a population that has a lot of variability. The
individuals in the population (the dice throws) can be any number between 1
and 20. The 6-sided dice represents a population that has only a little
variability. The individuals in the population (the dice throws) can only be a
number between 1 and 6.

By looking at the running averages (the bottom plot for each dice) we can tell
whether the samples _on average_ resemble the population. If most of the
averages fall very close to the population average then we can say the samples
_on average_ resemble the population.

Notice how for a given sample size (say 5 for each dice) the average of the
samples from the low variability dice (6 sided) do a better job of _on average_
resembling the population average. For the high variability dice (20 sided), the
averages of the same size samples do a poorer job of _on average_ resembling the
population average. The important part here in _on average_. Individual sample
averages may do a good job of resembling the population average no matter what
the sample size is. This demonstration tells use the **population variability**
is one factor that influences whether the averages of our samples will _on
average_ resemble the average of our population.

Let's say that our sample averages do a good job of resembling the population
average if the _almost all_ the sample averages fall within ± 1 of the
population average (the lines marked on the plot). Try adjusting the _sample
sizes_ for the two dice? What smallest value that will cause _almost all_ the
sample averages to land between the marked lines?[**Hint** If you can't work it
out try setting the sample size to **16** for the 6-sided dice and to **180**
for the 20-side dice.]{.aside} Notice how for high variability dice this value
must be far higher? This demonstration tells use the **sample size** is the
second factor that influences whether the averages of our samples will _on
average_ resemble the average of our population.

With all this talk of how the sample means **varies** from sample to sample you
might think that we would be able to **quantify** this variation. When we talked
about the **standard deviation**, we said that it told us how much the _average
deviation_ is **within** a sample. So could we use a similar measure to quantify
the _average deviation_ **between** samples? It turns out that we can. But
before we get there we'll have to take a brief digression to talk about
**distributions**.

## Distributions

Up until now we've skirted around the idea of distributions. We've looked at
histograms of data, but we haven't really talked that much about their shape. It
turns out that there are some shapes that we'll come across very often, and some
of these shapes have properties that will make them very useful for statistics.
But before we can get to that, we need to first understand where these shapes
come from---that is, distributions have the shape they do---and some language
for describing these shapes. We'll start off with the simplest distribution, the
**binomial distribution**, before moving on to the **normal distribution**. 

### The binomial distribution


To understand what the **binomial distribution** is, and where it comes from
we'll do a little _thought experiment_. In our thought experiment, we'll take a
coin, and we'll flip it. When we flip a coin, one of two outcomes is possible.
Either the coin will land showing heads, or it will land showing tails. We can
say that there are two possible events or two possible sequences of events
(_sequences_ will make more sense when we add more coins) that can happen when
we flip a coin.

Now let's think of each of the sequences and count up how many heads are showing
in each. In the first sequence, where the coin lands showing tails, no heads
occur. In the second sequence, where the coin lands showing heads, there is one
head. Therefore, we have one sequence that produces 0 heads, and one sequence
that produces 1 head. And those are all the possible sequences.

But now let's make it more complicated. Let's flip two coins. Now there's a
greater number of possible sequences. We can list them:

1. The first coin shows heads, and so does the second (HH),
2. The first coin shows heads and the second shows tails (HT)
3. The first coin shows tails and the second shows heads (TH)
4. and the first coins shows tails and the second shows tails (TT)

Therefore, there are four possible sequences. Let's count up the **number of
sequences** that lead to 0 heads, one head, two heads, etc. If we do this, we'll
see that one sequence leads to 0 heads (TT). Two sequences lead to 1 head (HT,
and TH). And one sequence leads to 2 heads (HH).

Let's now add more coins. Things will get trickier from here because the number
of sequences rapidly goes up. With three coins, there would be eight possible
sequences, and with four coins, there would be 16 possible sequences. Figuring
out the number sequences, and the nature of the sequences (whether they produce
0 heads, one head, two heads, etc.) quickly becomes difficult. To make things
easier, we'll draw a plot. First, we'll draw a plot to trace out the sequences.
We'll use different coloured dots to indicate heads and tails. We can do this in
the form of the branching tree diagram shown in Box \@ref(fig:box2). 


Once we've visualised the sequences, it's easy to count up how many sequences
result in 0 heads, one head, two heads etc. We can put our counts on another
plot. For this, we'll make a frequency plot or histogram, just like we've seen
before. On the x-axis, we'll have the number of heads. And on the y-axis, we'll
have the count of how many sequences result in that number of heads. This
frequency plot is also shown in @fig.

You can adjust the slider in Box \@ref(fig:box2) to change the number of coins
you want to flip. Increasing the number of coins increases the number of
possible sequences, and it changes the number of ways of getting one head, two
heads, three heads and so on changes (however, there's always only one way to
get 0 heads and one way to get all heads). Notice that as you adjust the slider
and add more and more coins, the frequency plot takes on a characteristic shape.
You can mathematically model the shape of this plot using a **binomial
distribution**.

In our coin flipping example, we created this shape by counting up the number of
sequences that produced various quantities of heads. But if we look around at
**natural processes**, we'll see that this shape occurs often.

One natural process that gives rise to this shape is the "bean machine"[^1]. In
a bean machine, small steel balls fall from the top of the device to the bottom
of the device. On their way down, they bump into pegs. When one of the balls
hits a peg, it has a roughly equal chance of bouncing off to the left or the
right, not unlike a coin which has a roughly equal chance of landing heads up or
tails up. At the bottom of the device are equally-spaced bins for collecting the
balls. If enough balls are dropped into the device, then the **distribution** of
balls across the bins will start to take on the shape of the **binomial
distribution**. Very few balls will be at the very edges, because this would
require the balls to bounce left or right every time.

Similarly, very few sequences of coin flips result in large numbers of heads or
large numbers of tails. The greatest number of balls are seen in the bins near
the middle. The balls that land here have bounced left and right a roughly equal
number of times. Again a similar pattern can be seen with the coin flips.

In Box \@ref(fig:box3), I've included a computer simulation of a bean machine.
Press the Start button to display the bean machine and watch the balls drop.
Press Replay to drop more balls.

Flipping coins might seem a log way off from anything you might want to study in
Psychology. However, the **shape** of the binomial distribution, particularly
when we're dealing with many coin flips, might be something you're more familiar
with. This characteristic **bell shape** is also something we see in the
**normal distribution**. And it's the **normal distribution** which we'll
turn our attention to next. 

# Lecture 8

## The normal distribution

In the previous lecture we encountered the **binomial distribution**. The shape
seen in the **binomial distribution** is also seen in another distribution
called **the normal distribution**. There are two key differences between the
normal distribution and the binomial distribution.

The **binomial** distribution is **bounded**. That means that one end represents
0 heads and the other end represents all heads. That is, the distribution can
only range from 0 to n (where n is the number of coins that have been
flipped)---it is bounded at 0 and n. The **normal distribution**, however,
ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity. Additionally, for the
**binomial distribution**, the steps along the x-axis are **discrete**. That is,
you can have 0 heads, one head, two heads and so on, but you can have anything
in between---for example, it's not possible to have sequences of coin flips that
results in 1.5 heads. In contrast, the normal distribution is **continuous**.

The **normal distribution** is a mathematical abstraction, but we can use it as
a **model** of real-life frequency distributions. That is, we can use it as a
model of **populations** that are produced by certain kinds of natural
processes. Because normal distributions are unbounded and continuous, nothing,
in reality, is normally distributed. For example, it's impossible to have
infinity or negative infinity of anything. This is what is meant by an
**abstraction**. But natural processes can give rise to frequency distributions
that look a lot like normal distributions, which means that normal distributions
can be used as a model of these processes.


### Processes that produce normal distributions 

In the previous lecture, we saw how sequences of coin flips, and the bean
machine, give rise to a **binomial distribution**, but what processes give rise
to a **normal distribution**. To see how a natural process can give rise to a
normal distribution, let us play a board game! We won't play it for real, but
we'll *simulate* it. 

In this game, each player rolls the dice a certain number of times, and they
move the number of spaces indicated by the dice. Not that dissimilar to what
you'd do in a game of monopoly, or a similar board game! For example, if a
player rolled the die three times and they got 1, 4, 3, then they wouldn't move
`r 1 + 4 + 3` (1 + 4 + 3 = `r 1 + 4 - 4`) spaces along the board. At the end of
one round of rolls we can take a look at how far from the start each player is.
And we can draw a histogram of this data.

In the simulation below, you can set the number of players and the number of
dice that they roll. We'll start off by just having 10 players, and each player
will roll the 1 die. 


TODO: Add the simulations in here

#### Processes that don't produce normal distributions

We won't cover other distribution shapes in much detail, but let us take a look
at an example of a process that doesn't produce a normal distribution. To do
this, we'll just modify the dice game in Box \@ref(fig:box5).

In Box \@ref(fig:box5), click the option that says **Multiply**. Doing so
changes the rules of the dice game so that a player's score is determined by
*multiply*ing together the values of their dice rolls. For example, under the
new rules, if a player rolled 1, 4, 3 then their score would be 12 (1 × 4 × 3 =
12). Now try clicking Roll! to see the shape of the distribution. This new
distribution has an extreme **skew**. The vast majority of players have fairly
low scores, but a tiny minority of players have extremely high scores. When you
have a process that grows by multiplying, then you'll get a distribution that
looks like this.

In psychology, we won't study many processes that grow like this, but some
processes that grow like this will be very familiar to you. Think about
something like wealth. Wealth tends to grow by multiplying. For example, earning
interest or a return on investment of 10% means that the new value of the
investment is 1.10 times the original value. This feature of wealth growth
explains why, for example, in the UK, the top 10% of people control more wealth
than the bottom 50%.

FIXME: Do I need to do something on describing normal distributions? Yes

### Describing normal distributions

The normal distribution has a characteristic bell shape, but not all normal
distributions are identical. They can vary in terms of where they're centered
and how spread out they are.

<!-- FIXME: Finish stuff on this, and include visualisation -->

<!-- TODO:
And include stuff here about how we can change the mean and the sd, but the
overall shape remains the same. Also talk about how if something is normally
distributed then we know a certain "amount" of the distribution will lie within
the x deviations from the mean -->

### Describing departures from the normal distribution.

When we looked at the example of the game where a players score was based on
**multiplying** together the dice rolls, it produced a distribution that was
**skewed**.

*Skew** is a technical term that describes one way in which
a distribution can _deviate_ from a _normal distribution_. The _normal
distribution_ is **symmetrical**, but a **skew** distribution is not. A
left-skewed distribution has a longer _left tail_, and a **right-skewed**
distribution has a longer _right tail_. Use Box \@ref(fig:box6) to explore
**skewness**.

<!-- FIXME: Add visualisation -->

Apart from **skew**, deviations from the **normal** distribution can occur when
a distribution either has fatter or skinnier **tails** than the normal
distribution. The _tailedness_ of a distribution is given by its **kurtosis**.
The kurtosis of a distribution is often specified with reference to the **normal
distribution**. In this case, what is being reported is **excess** kurtosis. A
distribution with **positive excess kurtosis** has a higher kurtosis value than
the normal distribution, and a distribution with **negative excess kurtosis**
has a lower kurtosis value than the normal distribution. In your research
methods courses, you probably won't come across many distributions that have
negative excess kurtosis. However, the distribution that describes dice rolls is
one such distribution, and this will be discussed briefly later in this course.
You will encounter distributions with positive excess kurtosis more often. In
particular, the _t_-distributions, a distribution with positive excess kurtosis,
will be used in several of the statistical procedures that you will learn. In
Box \@ref(fig:box7), you can explore excess kurtosis. When excess kurtosis is
set to 0, then the figure displays a normal distribution. Distributions will no
excess kurtosis are called _mesokurtotic_. When excess kurtosis is negative, the
figure displays a thin tailed or _platykurtotic_ distribution. And when excess
kurtosis is positive, the figure displays a fat-tailed or _leptokurtotic_
distribution.

## Distributions and samples 

Now that we've covered samples, distributions, and populations, we're going to
start putting them all together. We saw that whenever we look at the
distribution of values where the values are produced by **adding up numbers** we
get something that looks like a normal distribution. And we saw that when we
worked out the **mean of a sample of data** we did this by **adding up all the
values** and then _dividing that number by the number of values_.

Let's say that we want to measure some phenomenon---for example, scores on some
standardised reading tests. We collect a sample of data from 50 children, and
then we work out the **mean of this sample**, by **adding up the 50 scores** and
then dividing this value by 50. Now let's say that instead of only collecting
one sample, we collect 100,000 samples. We work out the **mean** for _each
sample_. And we then draw a histogram of the means for our 100,000 samples. What
will this distribution look like? In our games, any time we added up numbers, as
long as we added enough enough numbers, and we had a large enough set of
players, then we'd get a normal distribution.

The same goes for our sample. As long as we add up enough numbers (our sample
size) and we have enough samples (think, number of players) then the
distribution of the means (the distribution of the players scores) will be
**normally distribution**. This simple observation is fairly **central** in
statistics. So much so that it's called **the central limit theorem**.

### A distribution of our samples

The **distribution** of some statistic---for example, the **mean**---that we see
when repeatedly sample from the population is called **the sampling
distribution**. That's a bit of a mouthful so we'll try to unpack it a bit.

Let's us go back to example where we were working out the mean of a series of
dice rolls. In that example, we saw how the mean of our samples moved around
from sample to sample, so sometimes it was closer to the true mean, and
sometimes it was further away. We can see this in the box below.

<!-- TODO: Add box -->

Now instead of looking at our sample means wiggle about from sample to sample,
we're just going to collect a lot of samples and then plot the distribution. We
can see that here:

<!-- TODO: Add box -->

<!-- TODO: Need to emphasise sample size where it starts to look normal -->

As we can see, the shape of the **sampling distribution of the mean** is
unsurprisingly a **normal distribution**. Other statistics have sampling
distributions too. For example, we could calculate the **variance** for each
sample and the we could plot the **sampling distribution of the variance**. The
sampling distribution of variance **won't** be normally distributed. Why?
Remember that whenever we add stuff up we get a normal distribution, and working
out a mean is just a special way of adding up numbers. When we work out a
**variance** we're not adding numbers up. If you look at the formula, you'll
notice that there's a $^2$ in there. That means we're doing some multiplying.
And we saw that when we were multiplying numbers instead of adding them, we got
a distribution that wasn't normally distributed.

<!-- NOTE: Maybe pull the variance stuff out -->


Because the sampling distribution of **the mean** is **normally
distributed** (assuming the sample size is large enough, see
<!-- FIXME: Link to above somewhere -->
) it's centre and spread can be described the same way as any other
normal distribution. It will have a centre, or **mean** that is 
_equal to the population mean_. And it will have a spread, or
**standard deviation** that is _proportional_ to the _sample size_ and
the _population standard deviation_.

### Standard error of the mean

The _standard deviation of the sampling distribution_ of the mean has a special
name. It is called the **standard error** of the mean. 
<!-- TODO: As we saw above, how spread out the individuals samples were was -->
<!-- determined by two things. First, how spread out the population was and, -->
<!-- two, the sample size of the samples. -->
The spread of these individual samples **is the standard error**.
Therefore, just as we saw above, we know that the **standard error**
will get smaller as the sample size goes up. And we know that the
**standard error** will go down as the **population standard deviation**
goes down. We can see how these two factors works together when we look
at the formula for the **standard error of the mean (SEM)** in @eq-sem.

$$\mathrm{SEM}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$${#eq-sem}
