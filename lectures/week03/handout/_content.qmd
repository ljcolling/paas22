Doing research is an integral part of your training as a psychologist. But
before you can start thinking about **doing research** you need to be aware of
the different **approaches** that you can take. The aim of today's
lecture is to give you an overview of these approaches. 

In this lecture I'll primarily focus on two broad categories of approaches---
qualitative methods, and quantitative methods--but at the end I'll also briefly
mention how computer simulation can be used in psychology research. The current
module, as with most of the research methods modules you'll take in your degree,
is focused on quantitative methods. Therefore, this lecture will be the one
chance we'll have to discuss methods that don't fit neatly under the label
_quantitative_ until you have the chance to take more advanced courses later in
your degree.

## Introduction to Qualitative and Quantitative methods

Approaches to research are ordinarily split into two **broad categories**. We
can give some _simple_ descriptions of these categories.

1. **Quantitative** methods collect numbers/numerical data and use statistical
   tools.

2. **Qualitative** methods collect words, pictures, and artefacts.

As we'll see, either of these _approaches_ can be used to study a wide range of
phenomena, and they _don't_ map neatly on to different subfields of psychology.
Some researchers also adopt both approaches (_mixed-methods_) and some might
apply _quantitative methods_ to _qualitative style_ data. **Quantitative
methods** are probably easier to group together, because **qualitative methods**
include such a broad range of approaches. For this reason we'll start with
_quantitative methods_ first.

### Outline of quantitative methods

Quantitative approaches take a phenomenon and try to **condense** it down into a
few dimensions or **variables** that can be **measured** as _precisely and
reliably_ as possible. Because of this, it is very important to choose
**variables** that are **representative** of the phenomenon you're studying.
This process of choosing variables that are representative of the phenomenon
you're interested in is called **operationalisation**.

**Operationalisation** means choosing a **measurable** proxy for the phenomenon
you're interested in. This is not always an easy process and involves lots of
careful thought by researchers. How one researcher operationalises a phenomenon
might be different to how another researcher does. And debates between
researchers on exactly how to operationalise some phenomena can be common in the
literature. _Operationalisation_ will be an important part of your lab report.

Quantitative approaches often make use of **statistical methods**. Using
**statistical methods** means looking at lots of cases by, for example, studying
lots of people, and not just one or two. The goal with quantitative methods is often
to develop **generalisations**, or theories that are **generally applicable**.
This involves testing **predictions** that logically
follow from **theories** (the _deductive_ step).^[Refer to Lecture 2 if
you're unsure what _deductive_ means.]

### Outline of qualitative methods

**Qualitative methods** are focused on **meaning** rather than **measurement**.
Instead of **condensing** a phenomenon down **to a simple set of features**
dimensions (as is common in quantitative approaches), **qualitative research**
tries to examine **many features** of a phenomenon. Qualitative approaches can
do this, because instead of measuring many instances of a single variable,
qualitative approaches try to look at **all aspects** of one or a few
**instances**.

**Qualitative approaches** view the **context** (_physical environment_, _social
setting_, _cultural context_) as a **central** part of the phenomenon being
studied. In contrast, it is common for quantitative approaches to place less
emphasis on the context by abstracting away from it.

Qualitative approaches—for example, **grounded theory** and
**phenomenology**—also emphasise the idea of following the data wherever it
leads (that is, the _inductive_ step).

Qualitative methods is an umbrella term for a wide range of different
methodologies. Each of these will have their own underlying theoretical
assumptions and intellectual histories. I can't do justice to them all in one
short lecture. In fact, just one of these approaches would require an entire
course to itself if you were to learn enough about it to be able to apply it to
your own research. So instead what I'll do is just pick out a few and highlight
their key features.

The methods I have chosen are: (1) Verbal protocol analysis, (2) ethnographic
methods, (3) discourse analysis, and (4) phenomenology. However, there are many
more, including Case Studies, Grounded Theory, Participatory Research, and Focus
Groups, to name just a few.

I'll try to draw out some contrasts between **qualitative** and **quantitative**
methods more generally and highlight **strengths** and **weaknesses** of each
approach.

## Qualitative methods

### Verbal protocol analysis

Also known as **"_thinking aloud protocols_"** (or **"_talking aloud
protocols_"**). Verbal protocol analysis, involves collecting and analysing
verbal data on cognitive processing.

A typical setup might involve participants being given a task (usually a task
that involves multiple steps chained together). They are asked to
verbalise (speak aloud) what they are thinking as they go about solving the
task. Finally, the data (i.e., recordings of what the participant said) are
coded and analysed to infer the information processing steps involved in
solving the problem. Consequently, verbal protocol analysis can carry **certain
assumptions** about the nature of human cognition/thinking---for example, that
it involves _information processing in discrete sequential steps_. For an
example of verbal protocol analysis, see @tbl-vpa.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Example Verbal Protocol Analysis
#| label: tbl-vpa
#| echo: false
#| messages: false
readr::read_csv(here::here("data","vpa_example.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down"))
```

Although it might be common to associate qualitative methods with subfields of
psychology like social psychology and quantitative methods with subfields like
cognitive psychology, the qualitative--quantitative division does not map onto
subfields this easily. Verbal protocol analysis is one example of a
_qualitative_ approach that has a long history in cognitive psychology. The
approach was used in early _cognitive science_ by _Simon_ and _Newell_ who were
pioneering researchers in _Cognitive Science_ and _Artificial Intelligence_.

### Ethnography

More a **style of research** than a **method of data collection**, ethnography
involves studying people in "the field" (i.e., their naturally occurring
setting), and requires the researcher to **enter into the setting they are
studying**. It attempts to understand how the socio-cultural practices and
behaviours of people are shaped by their social, physical, and cultural
contexts. And it tries to make sense of events from the perspective of the
participants. Ethnography could include data from _interviews_, or _participant
observation_. In _auto-ethnography_, researchers engage in critical
self-reflection and treat themselves as the participant.

In **cognitive psychology**, ethnographic approaches have been used to
understand how people solve problems in **real-world settings**.
For example, how do **technological artefacts** (that is, the _context_) 
support cognitive processing. One famous study in cognitive ethnography involved
studying how sailors use technological artefacts (instruments etc) and
the layout of a ship to help them navigate.

Finally, in **critical psychology**, ethnographic approaches have been used to
understand the interplay between, **race**, **class**, **gender**, and
**education** in shaping participants' **life worlds**.

### Discourse analysis

Discourse analysis is the _social_ study of language as used in **talk**,
**text**, and **other forms of communication**.
It involves a distinctive way of thinking about talk and text where language
doesn't just **represent** the world but also **constructs** the world.

Some questions one might examine with this approach include: How does language
shape social relations? For example, how might certain kinds of talk establish
professional distance in doctor-patient communication? How might language
construct or open up space for particular identities. For example, how might
language enforce or break down the concept of binary gender?

The strengths of this approach are that it allows you to examine **how language
constructs reality.** It can make use of primary data (interviews, talk in focus
groups) or secondary data (books, newspaper articles). But it can be difficult
to use discourse analysis to develop the same kind of **generalisations** as you
might develop with other approaches.

### Phenomenology

This approach is associated with the philosophers _Husserl_, _Merleau-Ponty_,
and _Sartre_. The phenomenological approach involves **bracketing off** any
preconceived notions we might have about a phenomenon to achieve an
understanding of that phenomenon that has not been influenced by our prior
beliefs. Phenomenology emphasises peoples first-hand experience and attempts to
**understand** and **describe** subjective experience from the participant's
point of view.

In fields like **cognitive psychology**, phenomenology has been used to
understand the nature of subjective sensory experiences, skilled actions, and
even the nature of cognition itself (e.g., it has been used to argue against the
computational theory of mind).

To draw out the distinction between, for example, a **phenomenological** and an
**ethnographic** approach we can look at the example of studying an inclusive
classroom setting. A **phenomenological** approach might try to understand
**what it is like** for a student with a disability to be in that classroom
setting. While an **ethnographic** approach might look at how the classroom
setting **changes interactions** between students with and without disabilities.

### Issues in qualitative research

Unlike **quantitative methods** that might use **printed questionnaires** or
**computers** to record and measure responses, in **qualitative research**, the
**researcher is the instrument**. For this reason, it is important for
researchers to reflect on their **values**, **assumptions**, **biases**, and
**beliefs** to understand how these might impact the research. Because the
researcher is the research instrument, the research instrument can change during
the course of the research. For example, in _ethnographic research_, the changes
in the _researchers experience_ might alter how they record and observe
behaviours.

There are parallels to **validity** (_internal_ and _external_),
**reliability**, and **"objectivity"** in **qualitative research**^[We'll touch
on these topics today, but you'll also learn more about these concepts in coming
lectures]. These are **Credibility**, **Transferability**, **Dependability**,
and **Confirmability**.

**Credibility** means: Can the data support the claims? It can be established
through _prolonged engagement_, through discussions with other
researchers/participants, and through critical self-reflection.
**Transferability** means: Can the findings be transferred to similar
**contexts**? Establishing transferability requires extensive, detailed, and
careful descriptions of the research **context** (what are called **"thick
descriptions"**).
**Dependability** means ensuring that researchers maintain a record of changes in
the research process or research instrument (i.e., themselves) over time.
And finally, **confirmability** is concerned with ensuring that the data used to
support the conclusions are _verifiable_.

## Quantitative methods

As the name suggests, a key aspect of **quantitative methods** is
**quantification**. **Quantification** means putting numbers to the thing we're
interested in studying so that it can be **measured**.
The motivation behind **measuring** phenomena is that measurements are
**publicly available and verifiable** (e.g., other scientists can **check** or
**verify** your measurements).
Unlike _qualitative research_, where researchers try to simultaneously study many
aspects of a single phenomenon, **quantitative research** tries to condense a
phenomenon down into a single (or a few) dimension(s).

The first step in quantitative research is often figuring out how **to
quantify** the phenomenon of interest. This involves choosing a **proxy**
(something measurable) that can **stand-in for** the phenomenon. This process is
called operationalisation.

### Operationalisation

If you're interested in **anxiety**, you have to decide how to **measure**
anxiety, because you can't measure an **abstract concept** directly. The process
of choosing a **proxy** is known as **operationalisation**. There are lots of
ways to choose a **measurable** proxy that can stand in for **anxiety**. For
example, you could develop a **scale** or a **questionnaire**. Or you could
measure **physiological responses** like _increased heart rate_ or _galvanic
skin response_.

Measurements have to be **reliable** (reproducible) and **valid** (actually
measure what you think you're measuring). This means that if we were to develop
a scale for **depression** then the scale must produce similar numbers when
applied to the same person or to different people who are similarly depressed.
And if we were to use this scale to assess a treatment for depression
then the treatment should not just **reduce scores** on our depression
scale, but it must also **result in people experiencing less depression**.

### Quantitative methods and causation

Unlike **qualitative** research, which studies phenomena _in the wild_,
**quantitative** approaches try to exert a lot of **control** over phenomena.
This **control** allows researchers to make claims about **causation** and give
**causal explanations**.
There are a few ways to understand **causation**, and thinking about what
**causation** means will help us to think through ways to examine, study, or
identify it:

One view of **causation** can be summed up _as a **difference** that makes a
**difference**_: If you take two situations, one in which the phenomenon occurs
and another in which it does not occur, then whatever is different between those
situations is the **cause** of the phenomenon.
For example, take one situation in which a _window is broken_ and another in
which a _window isn't broken_. If the only difference between them is that in 
one _a boy has thrown a rock_ and in the other _a boy has not thrown a rock_
then **a boy throwing a rock** is the **cause** of the **broken window.**

You can also understand causation _in terms of **manipulation**_: If you can
manipulate one thing and observe a change in another, then the two things may be
**causally connected**. For example, as I _put my foot down or lift it from the
accelerator pedal in a car_ I can observe _a change in the speed of the car_, so
I know the **accelerator pedal** and the **speed of the car** are **causally
connected**. By intervening and manipulating parts of **a system** you can
identify how they work (you can identify **mechanisms**).


Finally, causation can also be understood _in terms of **probability**_: If the
presence of one thing increases the probability of the other thing occurring,
then there **may** be a **causal relationship**. For example, the presence of
_smoking_ increases the probability of _developing cancer_, so _smoking_ **may**
be the **cause** of _cancer_.


In the examples above, they are all examples of **possible** _causes_
To be justified in claiming a causal relationship **other conditions must
usually be met**.
And causal claims are not always [black]{.red} and [white]{.green}. Sometimes we
can only be more or less sure about causal relationships.

The control of confounds is an important part of trying to understand causal
relationships. To see the role of confounds in understanding causal
relationships, let us look at the example of smoking and cancer.
The presence of _smoking_ increases the probability of _developing cancer_, so
_smoking_ **may** be the **cause** of _cancer_. But _having emphysema_ also
increases the probability of _developing cancer_. So is _emphysema_ the
**cause** of _cancer_?

There is a **plausible mechanism of action between** _smoking_ and _cancer_ but
not between _emphysema_ and _cancer_, so we can be more sure that _smoking_
**causes** _cancer_ than we can be about _emphysema_ **causing** _cancer_.
A more likely explanation is that _emphysema_ and _cancer_ have a **common
cause**—_smoking_.

Let's say you are studying the relationship between _emphysema_ and _cancer_,
because you think _emphysema_ might cause _cancer_. In this situation, _smoking_
is a **confound**. If you wanted to see whether _emphysema_ caused _cancer_ then
you'd have to **control for smoking**. To do this, you might only look at
smokers and see if there's still a relationship between emphysema and cancer or
whether cancer also occurs in the absence of emphysema. Or you might only look
at non-smokers and see whether emphysema and cancer are still related or whether
cancer develops in the absence of emphysema.

Emphysema and cancer are **correlated** (the increase in one is associated with an
increase in the other), but emphysema doesn't cause cancer because they have a
common cause. Sometimes two correlated variables have a causal relationship,
such as the correlation between smoking and cancer. Sometimes they have a common
cause---such as the correlation between developing emphysema and cancer. And
sometimes, they have neither. For example, the correlation between the number of
men getting engineering degrees and per capita consumption of sour cream (see
@fig-cream).

```

## Qualitative vs Quantitative methods

In qualitative research, you study phenomena **in context** while in
quantitative research you aim for **control**. But you can use either approach
to study the same phenomena and psychological processes. Let's say you're interested
in **memory**: How could you study **memory** from a **qualitative** perspective?
And from a **quantitative** perspective?

When using a quantitative approach you might use experiments in a lab where you
give people lists of words to remember. You could _manipulate_ aspects of the
words—for example, their **emotional salience**—and measure performance
(accuracy scores) to try to understand something about **memory** and
**emotional salience**.

You would need to ensure that the only thing that differs between the words on
each list is the **emotional salience**. And you would need to control for
possible **confounds** like: **Word length**, by ensuring that one list doesn't
contain long words and the other short words. And **Word order**, by making sure
that some people get the lists in one order and some in the other order, to
ensure that memory differences aren't a result of people getting tired from the
experiment.

For a **qualitative** approach you don't want to study memory in the lab—you
want to study it in the wild. This allows you to **ask different kinds of
questions**. For example, you could use an _ethnographic_ approach with, for
example, bartenders. You might do fieldwork in a bar **observing** bartenders.
Through this, you might see that bartenders **structure their environment** in a
particular way—e.g., put certain types of glasses or bottles in particular
places. This might lead you to form the hypothesis that bartenders **structure
their environment** to support their memory—i.e., placing certain bottles and
glasses together helps them remember what goes in what kinds of cocktails.

You might then conduct follow-up interviews or discussions with bartenders or
observe the training of bartenders, which might provide further evidence for
this hypothesis. You might also engage in bartending yourself and critically
reflect on your own experience to understand how this **environmental
structuring** supports memory.

## Computer simulation

**Qualitative** and **quantitative** methods try to understand phenomena by
studying the phenomena themselves. The **data** they use comes from the world.
In approaches like **computer simulation** and **formal/mathematical modelling**
researchers instead **generate the data**. To do this, researchers try to
**build systems** that _replicate_ or _reproduce_ some aspects of systems or
phenomena they are studying. Doing so might allow them to **gain new insights**
into these systems. And **comparing** the behaviour of their **artificial
systems** with the **natural system** allows researchers to test theories about
the **processes** that produce phenomena.

**Computer simulation** has been used to study a lot of different phenomena in
psychology. However, the examples that I have found particularly interesting are
cases where **simulation** has been used to show how **seemingly complex
behaviour** can arise from **very simple processes**. For example, flocking
behaviour in birds seems very complex, and it looks **as if** there must be
something very complex going on inside their brains.
But you can **simulate** this behaviour with only three simple rules:

1. **avoid** collisions with other birds
2. **align** direction with nearby birds
3. **approach** distant birds

You can use @exm-boids to explore how these three rules influence the simulated
flocking behaviour in birds.

Another example of simple rules giving rise to complex patterns of behaviour
is Conway's Game of Life, which is a very simplified version of an Agent-Based
Model. Conway's Game Of Life has 4 simple rules: 

1. A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on

1. A live cell with < 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation)

1. A live cell with > 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation)

1. A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)

With just these 4 simple rules Conway's Game of Life can exhibit some very
complex behaviour. You can explore the Game of Life in @exm-gol. You can
learn more about Conway's game of life on the
[scholarpedia page](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Game_of_Life),

You can use the slider to select some of the more well known patterns. These
patterns produce some interesting behaviour such as oscillating at particular
rates. You can adjust the *Generation time* slider to speed up the simulation.

Each time you select *pattern 6*, a new random set of live and dead cells will
be produced. These random patterns might produce some interesting behaviour, or
they could just burst into live and then die off!

Finally, agent-based modelling takes a cue from approaches like those used to
model bird flocking and Conway's Game of Life. In an agent-based model, the
researcher simulates a group of 'agents'. The 'agents' will typically have some
memory, a set of goals, and some rules. The memory allows them to store their
current state or consequences of their previous actions. The goals usually
represent some state they're trying to achieve. And rules govern their
interactions. By allowing these agents to interact, and by manipulating aspects
of the agents (their memory, goals, and rules) it is possible to see how social
phenomena can arise.

Agent-based modelling can be used for modelling a wide range of social
phenomena. For example, it could be used to model the spread of misinformation
through social groups. If you thought that **misinformation** was more likely to
spread if passed on by particularly influential individuals (e.g., celebrities
or politicians), then you could examine this through an agent based model. Or if
you thought that misinformation was more likely to spread inside socially
isolated groups, then you could modify your simulation to create socially
isolated groups to test this hypothesis. After your simulation, you could still
go and check the real world to see if it behaves like your simulation. You're
unlikely to do any computer simulations as part of your undergraduate degree,
but if it's something you find interesting, then you might just get a chance to
do some as part of your final year dissertation. My aim in introducing it here
is really just to give you an idea of the broad range of approaches that are
applicable to psychological research.
