## Plan for today 

Today we'll learn about the **sampling distribution**

But before we can do that we need to know what **distributions**
are, where they come from, and how to describe them

- The binomial distribution

- The normal distribution

  - Processes that produce normal distributions

  - Process that don't produce normal distributions

  - Describing normal distributions

  - Describing departures from the normal distributions

- Distributions and samples

  - The Central Limit Theorem 

- The Standard Error of the Mean


---

## The Binomial Distributions

- The binomial distribution is one of the simplest distribution you'll come
across

- To see where it comes from, we'll just build one!

- We can build one by flipping a coin (multiple times) and counting up the number of
heads that we get

coins_label = htl.html`<label for="coins" class= "form-label" width="100%">Number of coin flips: ${
  coins - 1
}</label>`
```

- In @fig-sequences we can see the possible sequences of events that can happen if we
flip a coin (&#9864; = heads and &#9862; = tails)
@fig-binomdist look very interesting at the moment.

- In @fig-binomdist we just count up the number of sequences that lead to 0 heads, 1 head,
2 heads, etc

- As we flip more coins the distribution of number of heads takes on a characteristic shape

- This is the **binomial distribution**

---

## The binomial distribution

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

- The binomial distribution is just an **idealised representation** of the
process that **generates** sequences of heads and tails when we flip a coin

  - Or any other process that gives rise to **binary data**

- It's an **idealisation** but natural processes do give rise to binomial distribution


- In the bean machine (@fig-bean) balls fall from the top and bounce off pegs as they fall

  - Balls can bounce one of two directions (left or right; binary outcome)

- Most of the balls collect near the middle, and fewer balls are found at the edges

## The normal distribution

Flipping coins might seem a long way off anything you might want to study in
psychology, but the **shape** of the binomial distribution might be familiar to
you

- The **binomial distribution** has a **shape** that is similar to the **normal
  distribution**

But there are a few key differences:

1. The binomial distribution is bounded at 0 and n (number of coins)

    - The normal distribution can range from $+\infty$ to $-\infty$

2. The binomial distribution is _discrete_ (0, 1, 2, 3 etc, but no 2.5)

    - The normal distribution is _continuous_

The **normal distribution** is a **mathematical abstraction**, but we can use it as
**model** of real-life populations that are produced by certain kinds of
natural processes 

---

### Processes that produce normal distributions


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

To see how a natural process can give rise to a normal distribution, let's play
a board game!

There's only 1 rule: You roll the dice **n** times (number of rounds), add up
all the values, and move than many spaces. That is your **score**

- We can play any number of rounds 

- And we'll play with friends, because you can't get a **distribution of
  scores** if you play by yourself!

If we have _enough players_ who play _enough rounds_ then the **distribution of
scores** across all the players will take on a **characteristic shape**

:::

```{ojs}
//| echo: false

//| fig-cap: Distribution of players' position from the starting point
simple_dice_plot = Plot.plot({

})
viewof n_players = Inputs.range([1, 10000], {
  step: 1,
  value: 1,
  label: "Number of players"
})
```

:::

### Processes that produce normal distributions

- A players score on the **dice game** is determined by **adding up** the
  values of each roll

- So after each roll their score can increase by some amount 

The dice game might look artificial, but it maybe isn't that different to 
some natural processes 

For example, **developmental processes** might look pretty similar to the dice game

Think about **height**:

- At each **point in time** some **value** can be **added** (growth) or a
  person's current height

- So if we looked at the distribution of **heights** in the population then we
  might find something that looks *similar* to a normal distribution

A key factor that results in the **normal distribution** shape is this
**adding up** of values

---

### Processes that don't produce normal distributions

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Let's change the rules of the game

- Instead of **adding** up the value of each roll, we'll **multiply** them (
  e.g., roll a 1, 2, and 4 and your score is `r 1 * 2 * 4`)


- The distribution is **skewed** with most player having low scores and
  a few players have very high scores

- Can you think of a process that operates like this in the real world?

  - How about **interest** or **returns on investments**?

  - Maybe this explains the shape of real world **wealth distributions**...

### Describing normal distributions


:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

- The normal distribution has a characteristic bell shape but not all 
normal distributions are identical

- They can vary in terms of where they are centered and how spread 
out they are

- Changing $\mu$ and $\sigma$ changes the absolute position of
points on the plot, but not the relative positions measured in 
units of $\sigma$

  - E.g., ~68% of the points will lie between $\mu - \sigma$ and $\mu + \sigma$

```{ojs}
texmd` - The plot shows a normal distribution with a mean ($\mu$) of ${mean_value} and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of ${sd_value}.`
```

:::

  x: {

### Describing deviations from the normal distribution 

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}
When looked at the distribution of scores from the second dice game
we saw that it was **skew**

- **Skew** is a _technical term_ to describe one way in which 
distributions can deviate from normal


```{ojs}
skew_desc = md`- This distribution has a **skewness** of ${skew}. It is ${
  skew == 0 ? "symmetrical" : skew < 0 ? "left-skewed" : "right-skewed"
}.`
```

    Plot.line(skew_normal_plot(-4, 4, skew), {

### Describing deviations from the normal distribution 

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Another way to deviate from the normal distribution is to 
have either fatter or skinnier **tails** 

- The _tailedness_ of a distribution is given
by its **kurtosis**.

-  Kurtosis of a distribution is often specified with reference to the **normal
   distribution**. This is **excess** kurtosis. 

```{ojs}
kurtosis_desc = md`- This distribution has an excess kurtosis of ${
  kurtosis_values[kurtosis_value]
}. ${
  kurtosis_values[kurtosis_value] === 0
    ? "It is a **Mesokurtic distribution**."
    : kurtosis_values[kurtosis_value] > 0
    ? "It is a **Leptokurtic distribution**."
    : "It is a **Platykurtic distribution**."
}`
```

:::

```{ojs}
kurtosis_plot = Plot.plot({
  x: {
    grid: true,

    Plot.line(dists[Object.keys(kurtosis)[kurtosis_value]], {
      x: "x",
      y: "y",
      strokeWidth: 4
    }),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})

## Distributions and samples

- We've seen that whenever we look at the distribution of values where the
  values are produced by **adding up numbers** we got something that looked
  like a normal distribution

- In Lecture 6, we saw that the formula for the sample mean was as shown in
in @eq-mean-sum, below:

$$\bar{x}={\displaystyle\sum^{N}_{i=1}{\frac{x_i}{N}}}$$ {#eq-mean-sum}


- So to calculate a sample mean, we just **add up a bunch of numbers**

- Let's say I take lots of samples from a population. 

   - And for each sample, I calculate the sample mean.

   - If we had to plot these sample means, then what would the distribution look
     like? 

---

### The sampling distribution of the mean

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

We can try it out. 

- Let's say that I have a population with a mean of 100 

- And a standard deviation of 15. 

- From this population I can draw samples of `r 5^2` values 

- I'll do this 100,000 times and plot the results in @fig-sampling-r

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| label: fig-sampling-r 
#| fig.cap: Sample means from 100,000 samples (sample size = 25)
#| message: false

sd <- 15
n <- 5^2

d <- parallel::mclapply(1:100000, samp) |> unlist()

```

:::
::::




The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean (the plot in
@fig-sampling-r) has a special name:

_It's called the **standard error of the mean**!_


---

## The Central Limit Theorem 

Before we move on to how to calculate the **standard error of the mean** I want
to assure you something

- You might think that the **sampling distribution of the mean** in
  @fig-sampling-r is normally distributed because the **population**
  is normally distributed

- But this is not the case, as your sample size increases, then sampling
  distribution of the mean will be normally distributed 

- And this will happen even if the **population is not normally distributed**

---

## The Central Limit Theorem 

::::{.columns}

- If the sample size is large enough, then the **sampling distribution of the
  mean** will approach a normal distribution. This occurs even if the
  **population** _isn't_ normally distributed

\
I showed you @fig-se (above) where the **average deviation of sample means from
the population mean** was either small (A) or large (B)

---

## The standard error of the mean

I asked you to image two scenarios: One that was a feature of the
**population** and one that was a feature of the **samples** where the
**average deviation of sample means from the population mean** would be small
(or zero).

If you managed, then great! But if not, then here they are:

1. If the **average (squared) deviation** in the **population** is 0 then the
**average deviation of sample means from the population mean** would be 0

    - Because all members of the population would be the same, so all
    samples would be the same, so all sample means would be the same

    - Conversely, if the **average (squared) deviations** in the **population**
      was larger, then the **average deviations of sample means from the
      population mean** would be larger

---

## The standard error of the mean

2. If the **sample size** was large (so large to include the entire population)
   then the **average deviation of sample means from the population mean**
   would be 0

    - Because every sample would be identical to the population, so every sample
    mean would be identical to the population mean

    - Conversely, if the sample size was smaller, then the **average deviations 
    of sample means from the population mean** would be larger


Let's put these two ideas together to try come up with a formula for the
**average (squared) deviations of the sample means from the population mean**

Our formula will include:

- $n$: the sample size

- $\sigma^2$: the average (squared) deviations in the population (aka the
  variance of the population)

- And we'll call our result $\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2$

---

## The standard error of mean

The only way to combine $n$ and $\sigma^2$ so that:

1. when $n$ is very big $\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2$ will be small (and vice versa) and 

2. when $\sigma^2$ is very small $\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2$  will be small (and vice versa)

is formula is @eq-se-var, below:

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$${#eq-se-var}

But remember, we don't actually know the true $\sigma^2$ (the variance of the
population), we only know $s^2$ (the sample variance, which is out estimate of
the variance in the population). So we'll make a slight change to the formula 
as in @eq-se-var2

$$s_{\bar{x}}^2=\frac{s^2}{n}$${#eq-se-var2}

---

## The standard error of mean

- There's one final step to get to the formula for the **standard error of the mean**.

- The formula in @eq-se-var2 is framed in terms of the **average (squared)
  deviations) of sample means from the population mean**---that is, in terms of
  variance. 

- But the standard error of the mean is the **standard deviation of the
  sampling distribution**

- The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance, so we just
  need to take the square root of both sides of @eq-se-var2, to get the
  equation in @eq-se, below:

$$s_{\bar{x}}=\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$${#eq-se}


More commonly, however, you'll see $s_{\bar{x}}$ just written as $\mathrm{SEM}$ 
for **Standard Error of the Mean**

And is the formula for the **standard error of the mean** and where it comes from

---

## The standard error of mean

_This was, admittedly, a fairly long winded way to get to what is essentially a
very simple formula_

- However, as I have alluded to several times, the **standard error of the
  mean** is a fairly misunderstood concept

- I hope that getting there the long way has helped you to build a better
  intuition of what the standard error of the mean actually is

_I dislike talking about misconceptions because I think it can sometimes create
them_

But it worth talking about **one prominent one**

<font color="red" weight="strong">Misconception</font>

_The SEM tells you how far away the sample mean is (likely) to be from 
the actual population mean_
