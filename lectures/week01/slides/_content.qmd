## Introductions

In addition to the three main people there's also:

- Dr Bryan Singer who is responsible for the special **Research Ethics** lecture
  and the assessment that goes with it

- An entire team of doctoral tutors who are there to help you in the practical
  classes and who will be responsible for marking your lab report

Knowing who is responsible for which sections of the course will help to make
sure that you contact the correct person

_We spend a lot of time just **re-directing** queries, so just directing queries
at the correct person will save everyone a lot of time_

---

## Tips for doing well

The **most important** thing you can do to make sure you do well is **attend all
the classes**

Coming to the lectures each week means:

You get exposed to all the lecture content **without even trying**!

- It might be tempting to just watch the recordings, but it's really easy to
  fall behind

But **more importantly** so much of what makes university great is the stuff
that happens around the classes

- You get to meet me and talk to me after class

- You'll get to meet to your classmates

- You'll get more of an authentic university experience

---

## Tips for doing well

Apart from showing up every week, the other thing you should do is:

Do all the assessments!

- This is particularly true to the assessments related to the practical content!
- Each of these assessments _builds on the previous one_, so if you miss too
  many it can be _difficult_ to catch up.

For all the assessments you'll do during the course, whether it's the

- Assessments related to `R`
- Or the Lab Report

it'll be the first time you'll be doing anything like them

This means they might appear **daunting**, but you're all in the **same boat**,
and if you stick with it, I **know** you can be **successful**

---

## Tips for doing well

**Psychology as a Science** is **not** a difficult course, but most of the
material we'll be covering will be _very new_...

For example, I've mentioned `R` several times, but all you are probably thinking
"what is R?"


I don't expect any of you will know what `R` is, but that is something you'll
learn about in this course!

\

Don't feel bad if you don't know what `R` is or if you've never come across any
other material in this course. If you **knew** all the material in this course,
then this course will be pointless!

\

You're here to **learn new stuff** and we **don't assume any background
knowledge**^[Not even A-Level Psychology is assumed knowledge]


---

## Finding the information you need

All the information you need is on **canvas**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","canvas_home.png"))
```

---

## Finding the information you need

Click through all the links and read the information


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","module_navigation.png"))
```

---

## Finding the information you need

- Keep a notebook handy while you read through the information on canvas

- Note down anything you think is particularly important

- Or bookmark pages you think are important

- Check out the **Frequently Asked Questions**



---

## Knowing who to contact

One thing that can be tricky when you're first starting at university is knowing
the correct person to contact if you need help.



**Admin queries**


- If you're meant to have an extension but it hasn't been applied correctly

- If you're unable to submit your lab report because you're unwell

If you have any of these kinds of queries then you should email the admin staff
at {{< var adminemail >}}


\

**Please** don't email teaching staff asking for extensions, because we can't do
anything about it.

See the handout (and **canvas** for more information about absences and
extensions)

---

## Knowing who to contact


**Queries about course content**

The lecturers are your point of contact if you have queries about the **course
content**

- For queries about the **lecture material** and **final exam** I'm the best
person to contact

- For queries about the **practical content** or the **lab report**, you should
take to **Dr Terry** or **Dr Costin**

\

The best way to get in touch with me is to talk to me after class!

\

**I'll always hang around after class to answer any questions**


---

## Asking for help

Apart from asking me a question after/during class, the best place to ask for
help is on the **Discord**

Sign up here: [https://discord.gg/TBf8Zju2xv](https://discord.gg/TBf8Zju2xv)


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="30%"}

You can also book into a drop in session on Canvas:

- Book me for lecture questions

- Drs Terry or Costin for
practical / lab report questions

- Anybody for general `R` queries

---

## Asking for help

The best ways to get help are to **talk to us directly** before/after
class, by using **the Discord**, or by coming to **the drop in sessions**.

\

You **shouldn't** need to email us unless there is a matter that you'd like to raise
**confidentially**. 

\

There's lots of ways to get help, so make sure you make use of these methods
first

---

## Research methods in Psychology

**Psychology as a Science** is only the **first** in a **series** of research
methods modules you'll do during your degree.

\

Following this module you'll take the following modules:

- Analysing Data (next term)

- Discovering Statistics (year 2)

- Quantitative and Qualitative Methods (year 2)


All these courses build on each other and prepare you for your **research
dissertation** in your **final year**

They're also a great way to learn a lot of transferable skills
that are useful outside university, for example: 1) how to analyse data; 
2) how to make sense of statistics; 3) computer programming/coding skills.

---

### Psychology as a Science (PAAS)

PAAS covers an introduction to the research process. Some of the topics we'll
cover include:

- Introduction to *Philosophy of Science*
  qualitative methods
- Basics of statistical theory

In the practical classes you'll be introduced to the `R` programming language
and you'll learn:

- The basics of programming using R
- How to process and summarise data
- How to draw plots in R

You'll eventually learn how to perform various kinds of statistical analyses
using `R`, so the aim of PAAS is to lay the foundation for this!

You'll also work with some of the same data data you'll be using
in **_Cognition in Clinical Contexts_**

---

### Analysing Data (AD)

- You'll learn the core statistical tests used in Psychology

- More advanced `R`, and using `R` to perform statistical tests

- You first chance to independently analyse some data

In AD it is assumed that you have basic knowledge of `R`, so it's very important
that you stay on top of the work in PAAS

Some of the work you do in **Analysing Data** will connect up with the work you
do in **Psychobiology**

---


### Discovering Statistics (DS)

- Move advanced statistical tests

- Focus on more complex statistical analyses

- More advanced R

Some of the work you do in **Discovering Statistics** will connect up with
**Developmental Psychology**

---

### Quantitative and Qualitative Methods (QQM)

- Advanced multivariate statistical techniques

- Non-statistical research methods such as interviews and discourse analysis

Some of the work you do in **Quantitative and Qualitative Methods** will connect
up with **Social Psychology**

*Research methods do not happen in isolation, but they're connected with
everything else you do in your degree*

---

## Why research methods?

- Dominant approach to **training psychologists** is the **scientist**
  **practitioner** **model**

- _Doing research_ is integral to this approach!

Just like _medical doctors_, who not only deliver treatments but also _develop_
treatments, _psychologists_ also _apply_ and _produce_ knowledge.

You want to do _what works_ and being able to **read**, **critique**, and
**conduct** research will help you know _what works_ and allow you to develop
_evidence-based care_

Even for those that don't become psychologists, research methods is a useful
skills that can prepare you for careers in, data science, civil service,
consultancy, and more

---

## Structure of this module

Like most research methods modules PAAS is made up of **three** main activities:

1. Weekly lectures

   - One hour each week.

   - Covers research methods, statistics, and theory

   - Note that you'll also have a special lecture one evening in Week 6 that
     will cover research ethics. Check your timetable!

Note, that **Psychology as a Science** does not have an additional reading list,
because you'll have enough `R` homework for the practicals to keep you busy

---

## Structure of this module

2. Tutorials/Practical preparation homework

   - About an hour a week.

   - Done in `R` as preparation for the practical class.

3. Practical classes

   - Two hours a week.

   - Gives you hands-on experience with the `R` programming language.

You'll find out more about the exact structure of the tutorials and practicals in
the practical sessions.

---

### Assessment Structure

For the assessment there's a 50/50 split between **coursework** and the
**exam**.

The coursework is made up of four parts. Pay special attention to this section,
because the list on **Sussex Direct** can be a little confusing.

1. **Computer Based Exam** worth 10% due in Week 8

   This will cover the material from the _ethics lecture_ in Week 6

1. **Computer Based Exam** worth 40% (Beware confusing due data on Sussex
Direct)

   This refers to the `R` assessments that you'll do. You'll find out more about
   these in the practical classes. 

It's **very important** to note that this isn't a single assessment due at the
end of term. 

Consist of several assessments you'll do through out
the term. Make sure you keep up with them, because doing them will help you
achieve a good grade.

---

### Assessment Structure


1. **Report** worth 40% due in Wk 9

This is the major piece of written work you'll do, and you'll find out more in
the practical classes

1. **Portfolio** with 10% (Beware confusing due date on Sussex Direct)

   This refers to the 20 credits worth of research participation that you're
   required to do as part of the course. To find out more about this follow the
   big yellow link labelled [**Research
   Participation/Sona**](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/23036/pages/research-participation-module-credits-scheme).

Again, it's **very important** to note that the due date is the _final day_ you
can complete research participation.

**But don't wait until the last week** to do it, because there'll probably be no
studies left to take part in. 

Research participation is also important for your academic
development, because it will give you a first-hand experience of the research
process.

---

## Lecture topics

Lecture topics divided into **two** sections

In **part one** you'll do:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

lectures <- list.files(
  path = here::here(), pattern = "info.json",
  recursive = TRUE,
  full.names = TRUE
)

get_details <- function(file) {
  json_data <- jsonlite::read_json(file)
  tibble::tibble(
    Week = json_data$week,
    Topic = json_data$title
  )
}

purrr::map_df(lectures, ~ get_details(.x)) |>
  dplyr::arrange(Week) |>
  dplyr::slice(1:5) |>
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "l")) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, bootstrap_options = "striped")
```


These lectures are all about the **research process**, and they'll prepare you
for the **lab report**


---

## Lecture topics

In **part two** you'll do:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

lectures <- list.files(
  path = here::here(), pattern = "info.json",
  recursive = TRUE,
  full.names = TRUE
)

get_details <- function(file) {
  json_data <- jsonlite::read_json(file)
  tibble::tibble(
    Week = json_data$week,
    Topic = json_data$title
  )
}

purrr::map_df(lectures, ~ get_details(.x)) |>
  dplyr::arrange(Week) |>
  dplyr::slice(6:11) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = c("l", "l")) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"), full_width = TRUE)
```

These lectures focus on **statistical concepts**, and they'll prepare you for
learning about *statistical testing* in **Semester two**

---

## Lecture topics

The first set of lectures will cover _big picture_ ideas. These lectures will
probably be most useful in helping you to prepare for the report.


- What are scientific theories?

- What issues do we need to consider when we're measuring phenomena?

- What does it mean to operationalise our variables?

- What are different approaches you can take when conducting a study?

- What are some sources of bias in psychology studies and publishing of
  psychology studies, and how might we be able to ameliorate some of these
  biases?

---

## Lecture topics


The second set of lectures are all about preparing you for learning about 
statistics and working with data.

In these lectures you'll learn the underlying theory of _statistical testing_.
You'll learn how to _reason about statistics and data_, and the relationship
between scientific hypotheses and statistical hypotheses.

Doing statistics isn't like following a recipe. It's **not** about just picking
the **"correct"** statistical test out of a list.

It involves thinking about what you want to know, why you want to know it, and
how statistics can help you to know it. So we spend a bit of time this term just
learning about this reasoning before you actually learn about statistical tests
next term.


---

## Closing thoughts

- Can't **emphasise enough** that this course is not **inherently** difficult

- **Most people** do **very well**

- **BUT** you'll only do well if you **keep up with the work**

This means:

- Coming to all the classes (Lectures and Practicals)

- Doing all the assessments (particularly the `R` assessments) 

- Doing all the `R` tutorial activities

- Coming to drop in sessions if you're stuck or confused about anything

The better you do in this course, the easier you'll find the methods courses
that follow

And the better you do at **methods** the better you'll do in your **final year
dissertation**
