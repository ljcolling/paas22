The aim of today's lecture is to provide you with an overview of the structure
of the research methods modules that you'll be taking in your degree. I'll also
try to give you some tips that will help you to succeed in this course. Although
this is not an inherently difficult course, a lot of the material you'll be
encountering may be new to you. Some of it might even seem a little intimidating
(in particular, the programming that you'll be doing in the practical
classes). But if you stick with it, and give it your best shot, then I'm
confident that you'll be able to do well.

## Introductions

The main teaching team for **Psychology as a Science (PAAS)** is made up of
three people. Each of us has different roles and responsibilities. Knowing this
will help you to know who to contact if you need help with something (but see
more on [knowing who to contact](#knowing-who-to-contact) below).

**Dr Lincoln Colling** (lecture content convenor)

Dr Colling is responsible for the lecture content, and for preparing the final
exam. The final exam will cover the topics covered in the main weekly
lectures.

**Dr Jenny Terry** (practical content convenor)

Dr Terry is responsible for the content covered in the practical sessions, the
`R` homework activities, and the weekly `R` assessments. She is also responsible
for the lab report, the major piece of written work you'll produce this year.

If you don't know what `R` is then don't worry---99% of the people taking this
course won't know what `R` is. But you'll learn all about `R` and `RStudio` in
the practical classes.

**Dr Vlad Costin**

Dr Costin, along with Dr Terry, is one of the lead practical lecturers.

Apart from these three people you'll also get to meet Dr Bryan Singer, who will
be the lecturer for the special ethics lecture in Week 6. There are also several
doctoral tutors who will be helping out with the practical classes and who will
also be responsible for marking the lab report.

## Tips for doing well

The information that most of you will want to know is how to do well in this
course, so we'll get it out of the way right up the front. The single best thing
you can do to do well in this course is to _show up to class every week_.
Turning up _in person_ every week not only means that you'll get exposed to
the lecture content, but you'll also get to meet me, talk to me, meet your
classmates, and talk to them too. So much of what makes university special are
those moments that happen around the classes. And all you need to do to
experience those moments is to show up to class every week.

Apart from showing up every week the other thing you can do is to do
_all the assessments_. This is particularly important for the weekly assessments
linked to the practical content. Each of these assessments builds on the one
before, so if you fall behind it can be hard to catch up. Even if you find them
difficult, you should still do them. They will get easier!

Start off by being present for everything and the rest will fall into place!

## Finding the information you need

One of the most important things you need to know if you want to succeed in the
course (and this is true of all the courses you'll be taking) is how to find the
information you need. The first place to look for any information is on Canvas.
If you're reading this lecture handout then you've probably already found
Canvas. The Canvas page for this course will be your one-stop shop for almost
all the information you need about this course. Familiarise yourself with it.
Especially the front page! Click all the links, and read through the pages. If
you have a question like "What do I do if I can't make a practical or lecture?",
then that information is on Canvas. If you want to know what the assessments are
for this course, then that will also be on Canvas. And If you want to know
whether references are counted as part of the word count for your report, then
that will be on Canvas too!

There's a lot of information on Canvas. In fact, there's probably too much
information, and so it can be a little overwhelming. To help with
this, I have two tips.

First, as I said above, click the links and read through all the pages. But
while you're doing this, keep a bit of paper or a notebook handy. Use this to
note down bits of information, or where to find certain information, so you can
check back when you need it. You can also bookmark pages that you think will be
useful later. And when you bookmark a page you can give it an informative title
that is meaningful to you. All this will help you find the information you need
when you need it. And remember, on any web-page you can hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
<kbd>F</kbd> (windows) or <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> (mac) to search for a
word. This is useful if it's a long page with a lot of text, and you're looking
for something specific.

Second, check out the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)]({{< var faq >}}). Here
I will list the answers to some questions that I tend to encounter often. You
might just find the answer to your question here. I will try to update this as I
encounter more frequently asked questions, so make sure to check back whenever
you're stuck. 


### Knowing who to contact

One thing that is tricky when you're first starting out at university is knowing
who to contact with your queries. Here are some tips to guide you in the correct
direction.

#### Admin queries

Admin queries are any queries than are not directly related to the course
content. For example, if you've been absent from class, and you want to inform
somebody, then that's an admin query. If you're meant to have an extension to
hand-in date for an assessment, but it hasn't been correctly applied, then
that's an admin query. If you're unable to submit and assessment because you're
unwell, then that too is an admin query. All admin queries should be directed at
the admin staff.

You can contact the admin staff by emailing them at [{{< var adminemail
>}}](mailto:{{< var adminemail >}}). If you'd specifically like to report an
absence then you can [{{< var absenceemail >}}]({{< var absenceemail >}}). For
more information about Attendance and Absences, check out the [page on
Canvas]({{< var absence_canvas >}}).

:::{.callout-important}

Lecturers can't grant extensions for assessments. Please don't email us to ask,
because there's nothing we can do about it.

For information about _Requests for Extended Deadlines_ see the information on
the
[Student Support Unit](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/studentsupport/support-needs/extensionrequests)
page.

:::

#### Queries about course content

The lecturers are your point of contact if you have questions about the course
content. Who you contact will depend on what section of the course your question
covers:

**For questions about lecture materials**

If you have a question about material that was covered in one of the regular
weekly lectures then the best person to get in touch with is me,
Dr Lincoln Colling. I can also help with
queries related to the final exam (because the final exam covers the material
from the regular weekly lectures).

The best way to get in touch with me is to grab me right after the lecture. I'll
always hang around for a few minutes to answer questions.
But if you need to run off then you can always book into a drop in session.
To book into a drop in session, use the calendar 
on the [front page of the module's canvas site]({{< var canvas >}}).


**For questions about the practical content**

If you have a question about something that was covered in one of your weekly
practical sessions then the best person to contact would be the practical lead
_for your practical_. This will either be Dr Jenny Terry or
Dr Vlad Costin.

Your practical lead will also be able to help you out with queries about the
weekly `R` assessments.

The best way to contact Dr Terry and Dr Costin is to talk to them in your
practical session.

**For queries about the report**

If you have queries about the report, then the best person to contact is
Dr Jenny Terry.

**For general `R` help**

If you have general `R` and `RStudio` queries, and you weren't able to get them
answered in class, then you can go to one of the **R Drop in Sessions**. You
_can_ go to any of the R Drop in Sessions, but try to go to one run by somebody
that teaches on PAAS. To book into an `R` Drop in session, use the calender on
the front page of the [module's canvas site]({{< var canvas >}}).


### Module Discussion Board (Discord)

The course discussion board is run through **Discord**. To sign up to the course
discord server use the following link
[https://discord.gg/TBf8Zju2xv](https://discord.gg/TBf8Zju2xv)

You may sign up under an alias so that you can ask your questions anonymously, 
if you prefer.

The Discord server will be checked regularly, but is not moderated 24/7. 
If anyone spots anything that could be deemed inappropriate, please tag the 
teaching team. Inappropriate posts will be removed, as will any repeat offenders.

:::{.callout-warning}

### Emailing the teaching team

You should only email the teaching team if you have something that you need to
discuss in confidence. Instead of emailing, the best way to get help is to check
the [FAQ]({{< var faq >}}). You can also talk to the lecturer during or after
class or you could post on the discussion board if you need help with something
not covered in the FAQ.

If you have longer queries, or need extra help with something, then book into a
drop in session using the calender on the front page of the [module's canvas
site]({{< var canvas >}}). Remember, book into a session with me if you have
a query about the Lecture content, or with Dr Jerry or Dr Costin if you have a
query about the lab report.

## Research methods in Psychology

**Psychology as a Science** is the first of a series of research methods
modules that you'll take during your psychology degree.

Following this module, you'll take the following modules:

- Analysing Data (next term)

- Discovering Statistics (year 2)

- Quantitative and Qualitative Methods (year 2)

These courses build up to prepare you for your **research dissertation** in the
final year. But they're also a great way to learn a lot of transferable skills
that are useful outside university, for example: how to analyse data, how to
make sense of statistics, and computer programming/coding skills.

**Psychology as a Science (PAAS)** covers an introduction to the research
process. Some topics you'll cover include:

- Introduction to Philosophy of Science

- Different approaches to research including quantitative methods and
  qualitative methods

- Basics of statistical theory

We'll also introduce you to coding in the `R` programming language. You'll cover
the basics of the `R` language, how to process and summarise data, and how to
make plots in `R`. Along the way we'll work with some of the same data that
you'll be using for your **Cognition in Clinical Contexts** lab report.

In **Analysing Data (AD)** you'll learn about the core statistical tests used in
Psychology. You'll also cover more advanced use of `R`, and you'll learn how to
perform statistical tests in `R`. AD will also give you your first chance to
independently analyse some data.

In **Discovering Statistics (DS)** you'll learn even more advanced statistical
tests, and more in-depth knowledge of `R`.

And in the final course, **Quantitative and Qualitative Methods (QQM)** you'll
learn about advanced multivariate statistical techniques. But you'll also learn
about non-statistical approaches such as interviews and discourse analysis.

The work you do in these modules will also connect up with other modules:

1. **Analysing Data** with, for example, **Psychobiology**

1. **Discovering Statistics** with, for example, **Developmental Psychology**

1. And **Quantitative and Qualitative Methods** with, for example, **Social
   Psychology**

Research methods does not happen in isolation, but it's connected with everything
else you do in your degree.

### Why research methods?

The dominant approach to **training psychologists** is the **scientist
practitioner model**. _Doing research_ is integral to this approach! Just like
_medical doctors_, who not only deliver treatments but also _develop_
treatments, _psychologists_ also _apply_ and _produce_ knowledge. As a
_psychologist_ you want to do _what works_ and being able to **read**,
**critique**, and **conduct** research will help you know _what works_ and allow
you to develop _evidence-based care_.

Even for those that don't become psychologists, research methods is still useful
and the skills you'll learn in your research methods courses will prepare you
for careers in a range of industries. These might include working as a data
scientist, working in consultancy, or working in the civil service and
government.

## Structure of this module

Like most research methods modules PAAS is made up of **three** main activities:

1. Weekly lectures

   - One hour each week.

   - Covers research methods, statistics, and theory

   - Note that you'll also have a special lecture one evening in Week 6 that
     will cover research ethics. Check your timetable!

1. Tutorials/Practical preparation homework

   - About an hour a week.

   - Done in `R` as preparation for the practical class.

1. Practical classes

   - Two hours a week.

   - Gives you hands-on experience with the `R` programming language.

You'll find out more about the exact structure of the tutorials and practicals in
the practical sessions.

### Assessment Structure

For the assessment there's a 50/50 split between **coursework** and the
**exam**.

The coursework is made up of four parts. Pay special attention to this section,
because the list on **Sussex Direct** can be a little confusing.

1. **Computer Based Exam** worth 10% due in approximately Week 8

   This will cover the material from the _ethics lecture_ in Week 6

1. **Computer Based Exam** worth 40% (see below about due date)

   This refers to the `R` assessments that you'll do. You'll find out more about
   these in the practical classes. It's **very important** to note that this isn't
   a single assessment due at the end of term. Rather these consist of several
   assessments you'll do through out the term. Make sure you keep up with them,
   because doing them will help you achieve a good grade.

1. **Report** worth 40% due in approximately Wk 9

1. **Portfolio** with 10% (listed on Sussex Direct as due in Wk 11)

   This refers to the 20 credits worth of research participation that you're
   required to do as part of the course. To find out more about this follow the
   big yellow link labelled [**Research
   Participation/Sona**](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/23036/pages/research-participation-module-credits-scheme).

The due date is the _final day_ you can complete research participation. **But
don't wait until the last week** to do it, because there'll probably be no
studies left to take part in. _These are easy marks so don't miss out on getting
them._ Doing research participation is also important for your academic
development, because it will give you a first-hand experience of the research
process.

## Lecture topics

The rough outline of the lecture schedule is as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

lectures <- list.files(
  path = here::here(), pattern = "info.json",
  recursive = TRUE,
  full.names = TRUE
)

get_details <- function(file) {
  json_data <- jsonlite::read_json(file)
  tibble::tibble(
    Week = json_data$week,
    Topic = json_data$title
  )
}

purrr::map_df(lectures, ~ get_details(.x)) |>
  dplyr::arrange(Week) |>
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "l"))
```

The first set of lectures will cover _big picture_ ideas. These lectures will
probably be most useful in helping you to prepare for the report.

In these lectures we'll talk about issues like:

- What are scientific theories?

- What issues do we need to consider when we're measuring phenomena?

- What does it mean to operationalise our variables?

- What are different approaches you can take when conducting a study?

- What are some sources of bias in psychology studies and publishing of
  psychology studies, and how might we be able to ameliorate some of these
  biases?

The second set of lectures are all about preparing you for learning about 
statistics and working with data.

In these lectures you'll learn the underlying theory of _statistical testing_.
You'll learn how to _reason about statistics and data_, and the relationship
between scientific hypotheses and statistical hypotheses.

Doing statistics isn't like following a recipe. It's **not** about just picking
the **"correct"** statistical test out of a list. It involves thinking about
what you want to know, why you want to know it, and how statistics can help you
to know it. So we spend a bit of time this term just learning about this
reasoning before you actually learn about statistical tests next term.
