<!-- TODO: Add something about WEIRD if I haven't already -->

As I said in the previous lecture, the focus of this course, and most of the
undergraduate research methods courses that you will take, will be on
quantitative methods. Today will be the start of our journey of learning more
about the specifics of **study design** for _quantitative_ _research_.

_Quantitative research_ is all about **measurement**, and the aim of _quantitative
research_ is to take a phenomenon and condense it down into a few **variables**
that can be **measured** as _precisely_ and _reliably_ as possible. We also
saw that _quantitative research_ often made use of statistical methods, and that
the aim of _quantitative_ _research_ was often to develop **generalisations** or
**generally applicable** theories. In today's lecture, we're going to learn a
bit about how to **design** quantitative studies so that _all these things are
possible_.

## The "how" of quantitative research

The conclusions that we can draw from our research depends on how that knowledge
was generated and the research design that was used. For any piece of research that
we conduct (or piece of research that we read), we need to be able to answer
several questions: 1) How do we actually test **hypotheses** appropriately? 2)
How do we **generalise** our findings? 3) How do we **quantify** seemingly
unquantifiable things? The answer to these questions lies in **research
design**.

### Research design

We can use different types of research design to answer different **research
questions** and to test different **hypotheses**.^[If you're not sure what the
terms **research question** and **hypothesis** mean, then just keep them in your
mind for now. Their meanings will become clearer when we get to the
examples.] Study designs can vary along many dimensions. For example,
study designs can differ on whether they include a **manipulation** or not. They
can differ on whether they use a **between-subjects** or **within-subjects**
measurement. And they can differ with respect to the **time frame** used for
data collection.

Study designs are usually broken into two broad categories: _Experimental_ and
_non-experimental_ designs. The key feature of **experimental
designs** is that there is some form of **manipulation**. By **manipulation**,
we just mean some sort of change that is introduced that may have some impact on
the thing our study is measuring. The **manipulation** might be something that
is intentionally introduced by the experiment, or it might be some change that
is naturally occurring. We'll see that this will be the difference between _true
experiments_ and _natural experiments_.

Not all possible designs include manipulations. Designs that don't include
manipulations are known as **observational** or **correlational** designs. In
correlational designs we rely on **observed data** that are not subjected to any
**experimental manipulation**. By _observational_, we don't mean that we're
_just looking_. There is still measurement, whether this is through
questionnaires, lab tasks, or similar.

**Correlational** designs have several **practical** advantages over
**experimental** designs. These include the ability to collect data from far
more people than would be practical for an experimental design. And they also
allow us to study phenomena where experimental manipulations would be
_unethical_. But correlational designs also have drawbacks when compared with
experimental designs. In particular, while correlational designs can be used to
investigate **relationships** between variables, but in order to make **causal**
claims, experimental designs (whether true experiments or natural experiments)
are needed.

## An example: Ice cream and murder

In @fig-murder we can see a plot of the relationship between the murder rate and
the number of ice creams sold in New York City. We can see from the plot that
when the murder rate is high then the number of ice cream sales is also high and
when the murder rate is low then the number of ice creams sold is also low. But
are they _just correlated_ or does ice cream _cause_ murder?

#| fig-cap: The relationship between the murder rate and ice cream sales in New York City
#| label: fig-murder
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","IC.jpg"))
```

We might decide to conduct some research into this relationship between ice
cream and murder to see whether there actually is some sort of causal
relationship. Obviously, there are **many** ethical issues with conducting an
experiment on this, but let's put those aside for now and see what such an
experiment might actually look like.

The first step in our experiment would be to specify our **research question**.
In this example, our research question might be something like: _Does eating ice
cream make you more prone to murderous tendencies?_ From this we can now
formulate our **hypothesis**. In our **hypothesis** we will actually specify the
outcome we expect. Our hypothesis might be something like: _Eating ice cream
increases the desire to commit murder_.

Testing our hypothesis with an experiment might involve something like the
following steps: First, we might invite a group of people into the lab. Half these
people will be given some ice cream to eat, and the other half will not be given
ice cream. This is our **manipulation**. Next, we might get all of our
participants to look at several images of people (our _stimuli_) while we get to
rate how much they want to **eliminate** them on a scale of 0 (no desire) to 9
(all the desire possible).

In this study, we have an **independent variable** (IV) or _predictor variable_.
This is the thing that we're manipulating. In our case, this is whether people
ate ice cream or not. We manipulated our IV by assigning people to one of **two
groups**: The _ice cream condition_ or the _no ice cream condition_. We also
have one **dependent variable** (DV) or _outcome variable_. In our case, this
would be participants total score on our _desire to eliminate_ measure.

After we have all our data we could then compare the results between the _ice
cream **condition**_ and the _no ice cream **condition**_ to see which group
gave higher ratings for their _desire to eliminate people_ (the **outcome** or
**DV**).

:::{.callout-tip}
### Independent and Dependent Variables

The terms **independent** and **dependent** variable are two pieces of jargon
that are important to learn. You'll come across them a lot in your research
methods modules (and in other modules like *Cognition in Clinical Contexts*).

The **dependent variable** is the variable that you analyse. Its value
*depends* on the values of other variables.

An **independent variable** is a variable that *influences the values* of your
**dependent variable**.

In our ice cream example, the variable we're measuring is the total score on
the _desire to eliminate_ measure. This is our **dependent variable**. We expect
this to be *influenced* by whether somebody was given ice cream or not. Because
we expect ice cream to *influence* our dependent variable, the presence, or
absence, of ice cream is our *independent variable*.

Independent and dependent variables might be measured at any [level of
measurement](#levels-of-measurement), and they might be [continuous or
discrete](#variabledata-types).

In the context of **regression analyses** (which you'll learn about later) the
DV is sometimes also called the _outcome_, and the IVs are sometimes also called
the _predictors_.

## Features of good study design

Our study of the relationship between murder and ice cream is an example of a
very unethical study, but it is also a _poorly_ designed study. In a
well-designed experiment, we can be confident in saying our **manipulation**
_caused_ a change in our **outcome variable**. But this isn't the case for our
ice-cream study. Let's take a look at some features of good study design to see
why.

### Controls

Our imaginary study didn't use _any_ **controls**. We recruited all kinds of
people without giving consideration to how different characteristics might
affect our results. Let's say, for example, that all the people that we
recruited were actually lactose intolerant and that for these people eating
ice-cream caused a great deal of discomfort. Perhaps it is actually this
discomfort that caused their murderous rage and their murderous rage is not
specific to ice cream _per se_. It could equally well be caused by drinking
milkshakes.

We might also not have had a standardised set of instructions that we gave to
participants. Some participants might have arrived very hungry and other
participants might have arrived very full. Maybe the differences that we observe
are actually a result of some participants being 
[hangry](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hangry).

Maybe we didn't control our **IV** appropriately. We might have often changed
the brand or the flavour of the ice cream. Some days we might have run out of
ice cream and used _frozen yoghurt_ instead. And some days we might have
given a small amount of ice-cream and on other days we might have forced our
participants to eat a large amount of ice cream. If we had so many changes
from participant to participant then it would be difficult to know exactly what
caused any changes in our **outcome**.

We might also not have controlled the lab environment adequately. On some days
the heating might have been up really high. And other days the air-conditioning
might have been up really high instead. Maybe it's just the heat that's driving
people into a murderous rage?

### Randomisation

Another feature that might have been missing from our study is that we didn't
**randomly assign** people to groups: Maybe we did our participant recruitment
first at a dentist's office and then at a supermarket. And maybe all participants
recruited first were assigned to the ice cream condition with the second batch
of participants assigned to the no ice cream condition. Because of this, it
might so happen to be the case that all the participants in the ice cream
condition just so happened to have sensitive teeth. This would affect the
results by giving us the impression that ice cream increases murderous
tendencies when it doesn't. To deal with these issues, participants should have
been sorted into groups **randomly**. A well-designed experiment would randomise
the **participant allocation** and the **stimulus presentation order** (in our
experiment, this refers to the order in which the images of faces were rated).

### Blinding

In our study, we might have told participants that we were interested in the
effect of ice cream on murderous tendencies. And we might have also given
participants the ice cream ourselves. Participants may have (consciously or not)
modified their behaviour to either fit the hypothesis or to contradict the
hypothesis. Because of this, it is crucial that participants are unaware of what
the hypothesis was and also what condition they have been allocated to. If
participants are naïve to group allocation then the study is to be
**single-blind**. If neither the participants nor the researcher know which
condition the participants are put in, then the study design is known as
**double-blind**. In such a case allocation might be recorded but only revealed
once the study is over and the data are being analysed.

### Theoretical framework

The choice of **predictor** (**IV**) and **outcome** (**DV**) variables does not
happen in a theoretical vacuum. Rather, these choices are based on theory. In
our experiment, the decision to have ice cream as the **IV** and murderous
tendencies as the **DV** was not based on any **theory**. It could be that
committing murder causes people to eat ice cream. In which case, we should
probably have swapped around our IV and DV. Or it might be that they're
completely unrelated. To have good reasons for running the experiment we did,
we would probably have to be able to tell some kind of a plausible story about
**how** eating ice cream a murder were related. Such a story would probably have
to make reference to some kind of psychologically or biologically plausible
mechanism that might explain the connection.

## Types of experimental studies

We've already talked about experimental designs through our example. But it's
worth spending a little more time talking about different kinds of experimental
studies.

### (True) Experiments

First, we have **_true_** **experimental studies**. True experiments usually
have tight controls. As a result, they can be somewhat artificial, because they
abstract away from reality. This means that they can sometimes lack something
called **ecological validity**. Ecological validity refers to the ability to
generalise the results of the study to **real-life** settings. That is, just
because something is true in the lab, doesn't necessarily mean that it will be
true in "the real world". Experimental designs do, however, provide the most
rigorous methodology for investigating **causal relationships**.

As we saw in our example, good experimental design requires randomisation,
manipulation, and adequate controls. For many research questions there are
methodological, logistical, and ethical obstacles that make it infeasible to
conduct experiments. In these cases, we might want to use a
**quasi-experimental** design or a **natural experiment**.

### Quasi-experiments

**Quasi-experimental** designs are similar to (true) experimental designs
**except** for participant randomisation**. As a result, they're used in
situations where it's not possible to randomise the allocation of participants
into groups. An example of a study using a **quasi-experimental** design might
be one looking at the effectiveness of attending summer school. If one school
offers summer school, but another does not, then we can't randomise students
into the intervention. In situations like this, we should still try to **match**
the participants so that the groups don't differ on characteristics that
might be relevant to our outcome, except, of course, for the characteristic
we're actually interested in---attending summer school.

### Natural experiments

**Natural experiments** are studies where randomisation and manipulation occur
through **natural** or **socio-political** means. A good example of a **natural
experiment** might be _twin studies_. Identical twins share 100% of their genes
while fraternal twins only share on average 50% of their genes. However, both
kinds of twins tend to share the same home environment (if they're raised
together). By comparing the degree of similarity (on some characteristic)
between identical and fraternal twins we might be able to estimate the degree of
variation in a characteristic that is due to genetic variation. Other examples
of natural experiments might be made possible by differences or changes in
government policy: For example, bans on cigarette advertising, or differences
the in length of compulsory education. Natural events, or even natural
disasters, might create the manipulations that natural experiments can be based
on.

## Aspects of study design

In our ice cream example, we used a between-subjects design, but this isn't the
only option available to us. And we just collected our data at one point in time.
And this too isn't the only option available to us.

### Within-subjects and between-subjects designs

In a **between-subjects** or **independent design** we compare different
**groups** of participants. For example, in our ice cream study, one **group**
of participants ate ice cream while the other **group** of participants did not.

Between-subjects designs can be contrasted with **within-subjects** or
**repeated measures** designs. As the name suggests, this kind of design
involves _repeatedly measuring_ participants, but **under different
conditions**. We can show the distinction by way of an example. Let's say that I
conduct a study where I'm interested in whether people are better at remembering
long words or short words. A _between-subjects_ design would involve getting one
_group_ of participants to remember long words and another _group_ of
participants to remember short words. With a **within-subjects** design,
however, all participants would be asked to remember the words under both
conditions (short words and long words). We'd measure their memory for words
under both of these conditions.

With **within-subjects** designs there are some additional things than we will
need to consider. For example, if participants perform one condition first
followed by the other condition, then we might need to consider whether there
are order effects present. It might be that participants are fatigued by the
time they get to the later condition and as a result they perform worse on it.
Or it might be the case that by the time they get to the later condition they
have already had some practise with the task and, therefore, they might perform
better.

Finally, we can mix **within-subject** manipulations with **between-subject**
manipulations. This is what is known as a **mixed-design**. To use our memory
example above, an example of a **mixed-design** might be as follows: First, we
might split our participants into **two groups** and give one group some special
memory training. All participants would then be asked to perform the task. We
could then examine whether the influence of the memory training made a
difference to whether people were better at remembering short words over long
words.


### Time frame

Studies can also vary in terms of whether participants are measured at one point
in time or whether they are followed over time.

In our ice cream example we took our measurements at one point in
time. Designs where measurements are made at one point in time are called
cross-sectional designs. Cross-sectional studies are logistically easier
compared to other types of studies, but they're not very useful in telling us
how phenomena change over time. For that, we need another kind of design.

An alternative to a _cross-sectional_ design is a **longitudinal design**. This
kind of design involves repeated measurement of the same characteristic of the
same participants at multiple time points. A classic example of this would be
studies that follow participants over time to understand the nature of
developmental changes in, for example, language. The logistics involved in
**longitudinal designs** can make them difficult to carry out. This is
particularly true where studies carry on for several decades. They can also be
time-consuming and expensive. And, finally, the risk of **missing data** (for
example, from participants dropping out of the study) is high. Missing data can
be difficult to deal with. Sometimes data can be missing at random. However,
it's also possible that data can be missing because participants with, for
example, particular characteristics are more likely to drop out. Consider the
case of a study looking at the effectiveness of online dating apps: If all the
participants that find true love drop out of the study then your dataset would
only consist of data from participants that were unlucky in love. As a result,
the data would show a 0% success rate for online dating apps!

## Issues in measurement

### Construct validity

A measure is **valid** if it measures what it's supposed to measure. In
psychology, we often want to measure things that may be difficult to observe
directly, and difficult to **quantify**. For example, things like happiness, or
cognitive ability, or personality. We attempt to measure these unobservable
things using a range of different tools including questionnaires or experimental
tasks. We design these tools by using the theoretical underpinnings behind the
constructs we are trying to measure. **Construct validity** is the extent to
which a tool can be justifiably trusted to actually measure the construct it is
supposed to measure.

### External validity

A study has **external validity** if its findings can be applied to the entire
population of people with the relevant characteristics. ^[We'll talk more about
**populations** in later lectures.] For example, if a study
uses a sample of white men in western cultures, the findings might only be true
for white men in western cultures. They might not apply or **generalise** to
_all_ people. In psychology research we should probably be spending more time
thinking about the **samples** we use and whether they're representative of the
**populations** we'd like to generalise our results to. For more on this
see below.


:::{.callout-tip}

### WEIRD samples

Several researchers have noted that the samples used
in the vast majority of psychology research tend to be rather **WEIRD**.
That is, the samples used in most published psychological science are
drawn from **W**estern, **E**ducated, **I**ndustrialized, **R**ich, and
**D**emocratic (WEIRD) societies [@weird]. The preponderance of WEIRD
samples implies that researchers either assume that there is little
variation across different population groups when it comes to the
phenomena they're studying, or that these samples are as representative
of **humans in general** as any other group.

But is this true? Answering this question is difficult because it would
plausibly be conditional on the nature of the research question or
phenomenon being studied. For example, it *seems* plausible that there
would be little variation across human populations when it comes to
phenomena like low-level auditory and visual processing. However, it
also *seems* plausible to expect to see more variation when it comes to
phenomena like moral reasoning, where cultural practices may play a more
prominent role. However, it is an empirical question---that is, it is a
question that can only be answered by looking at the actual data.
Unfortunately, the data required to answer these questions are sparse.
However, the data that does exist suggests that there is probably more
variation than people would expect, even when it comes to *low-level*
phenomena like visual perception [@weird]. In the past few years,
there has been some movement to try and make samples in psychological
research more diverse, but there is still a long way to go and,
therefore, this is an issue worth bearing in mind.

:::

We've already touched on **ecological validity** in discussing *experiments*
([see above](#true-experiments)). **Ecological validity**, which
is often an issue in experiments, refers to whether the findings of a study
apply to the "_real world_". Just because something is true in the lab doesn't
mean it's going to be true in the real world.

<!-- FIXME: Add WEIRD BOX IN HERE -->


### Reliability

Finally, **reliability** refers to the **consistency** of a measure. A measure
is **reliable** if it produces consistent results each time it's used on the
same participant. For example, we could measure someone's maths anxiety with
a questionnaire. Our questionnaire would be considered **reliable** if when we
tested the same participant on different occasions they got similar scores each
time. This stability over time is known as **test-retest reliability**.

## Levels of Measurement

The last couple of topics we'll cover in this lecture are about the jargon we
use to describe the nature of the measurements we're taking. The first set of
terms describe the kind of information we're working with. We call this the
**level of measurement**. There are four levels of measurement: 

1. Nominal/categorical

2. Ordinal

3. Interval

4. Ratio

Sometimes a construct can fall into many of these levels, and it's on the
researcher to decide what measurement level is the most appropriate to use.

**Nominal/categorical**, refers to **names**, **categories**, **labels**, or
**group membership**. Some examples include: 1) eye colour (e.g., green, brown,
blue); occupation status (e.g., FT employed, PT employed, unemployed,
student...); study condition (control, experimental); or marital status. Even age
can be nominal if we wanted it to be (under 50s vs over 50s).

When using nominal variables, we cannot compare the different groups in any
quantifiable way. That is, it doesn't make sense to say that green is more blue
when it comes to eye colour.

At the **ordinal level**, individual observations of the measured attribute can
be **ordered** in a meaningful way. For example, we could order marathon runners
ranked in order of who came 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. The ordinal level, however, doesn't
provide any information about the differences between individual points. For
example, we don't know how much faster the winner was compared to the runner-up.
The distance between 1st and 2nd doesn't have to be the same as the distance
between 2nd and 3rd, or between any adjacent pair of runner. An example of this
type of measure in psychology is the **Likert scale** (see @fig-likert).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-likert 
#| fig-cap: An example of a Likert scale
#| out.width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","LS.png"))
```

These scales are classed as **ordinal** because we can't say that the difference
in agreement between "Agree" and "Neither agree nor disagree" is the same as the
difference between "Disagree" and "Strongly disagree".

At the **interval** level of measurement, the differences (intervals) between
pairs of adjacent values are the same. For example, the difference in
temperature between 20°C and 21°C is the same as that between 35°C and 36°C.The
intervals marked by the degrees are evenly spaced or equidistant. But there is
not an absolute zero point, so we cannot say that 40°C is twice as hot as 20°C.
A good example, of this type of measurement in psychology is IQ. Someone with an
IQ of 200 is not twice as smart as someone with an IQ of 100, and there's also
no such thing as an IQ of zero.

Finally, there is the **ratio** level. The ratio level is similar to the
interval level, but with **ratio** data there is a **meaningful 0 point**.
Some examples of the ratio level of measurement that you might encounter in
psychology are: Reaction time, number of correct responses, score on an exam,
and income.

## Variable/Data Types

When using quantitative methods, we represent variables with a numerical value,
but we can have different types depending on the type of data it represents.
**Continuous variables** can contain any numerical value within a certain range.
Some examples might include time, height, and weight.

**Discrete variables** can only contain some values: For example, the number of
children. Hypothetically you can have any number of children, but it has to be a
**whole number**. There's no such thing as 2.4 children.

Finally, **binary variables** can only take one of two possible values. They are
a special case of **discrete variables**. Examples of this are _Yes or No_
responses, _Heads or Tails_, and _Pass or Fail_ scores.
