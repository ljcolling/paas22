## Quant Research: The What

- Two branches of investigation in psychology: **qualitative** &amp; **quantitative**

- **Qualitative** is concerned with **meaning** &amp; understanding subjective **experiences**

  + We will revisit qual in Year 2

- **Quantitative** aims to **quantify** &amp; **measure**

  + We use numbers to represent different **constructs** &amp; we can fit **mathematical** &amp; **statistical models** to those data

- The decision to use either method should be based on your **research question**

- Quantitative research is the focus of today, &amp; much of your research methods journey @ Sussex


---

## Quant Research: The Why

- We use quantitative research to obtain **generalisable knowledge**
  
  +   We can **generalise** our findings to other participants/contexts

- We can form a **scientific theory** which is a framework supported by observations

  + A theory should describe, explain, or predict phenomena

- We can develop **hypotheses** which are theory-driven predictions

- &amp; we can then use **statistical models** to test those predictions

## Quant Research: The How

- The conclusions we can draw from our research depend on how that knowledge was generated &amp; the research design used

  + But how do we actually test **hypotheses** appropriately? 

  + How can we **generalise** our findings?

  + How do we **quantify** unquantifiable things?

  + &amp; how can we be confident in our conclusions?

&lt;br&gt;

### The answer lies in quantitative research design!


---

## Quant Research: The How

- We can employ different types of research design to answer different **research questions** &amp; to test different **hypotheses**

- Study designs can vary on the presence or absence of a **manipulation**, whether they use **between-** or **within-subjects** measurement, &amp; the time frame used

- Some examples include:
  + **Observational**/**correlational** designs
  + **Experimental** designs (incl. **quasi-experiments** &amp; **natural experiments**)
  + **Longitudinal** &amp; **cross-sectional** designs
  
- Which design to choose depends on: 
  + The hypothesis to be tested
  + Resources (time, money, facilities)
  + Logistical considerations
  + Ethical considerations


---

## Manipulations

- The key feature of **experimental designs** is that there is some form of **manipulation** which changes an aspect of the study design to see whether it affects the study's outcome
  
- Designs that don't include manipulations are known as **observational** or **correlational** designs

---

## Observational/Correlational Designs

- In correlational designs, we rely on **observed data** which are not subjected to any **experimental manipulation**

- Observation doesn't just mean *looking*, there is still measurement, questionnaires, laboratory tasks, etc.

- Correlational designs allow us to collect data from lots more people compared to experimental designs

- We can use these types of design to investigate **relationships** between **variables** but they cannot tell us anything about **cause &amp; effect** 

- Some experiments would be **unethical**, but observational data can be a solution

- But because we cannot infer **causality**, we have to be careful with our conclusions..

## Conducting an Experiment

- Ignoring the *many* ethical issues for a sec, let's imagine this experiment...

- First, we would generate our **research question**: does eating ice cream make you more prone to murderous tendencies?
- Then we would come up with a **hypothesis**: eating ice cream increases the desire to commit murder

- To test our hypothesis, we could design an experiment where we invite a bunch of people into the lab:
  + Half of our participants eat some ice cream, the other half don't (our **manipulation**)
  + Then we get all participants to look at several images of people (the **stimuli**) &amp; rate how much they want to *eliminate* them on a scale from 0 (no desire) to 9 (all the desire possible)

- After the experiment has finished, we would thank our participant, we would **debrief** them by describing the aims of the study in more depth, &amp; send them on their way..

Then as they walk out we hear them say **'I could *kill* for an ice cream'** ðŸ˜°


---

## Conducting an Experiment

- In this study, we have one **independent variable (IV)**, or **predictor variable** which is the group people were assigned to (ice cream or no ice cream) &amp; we have one **dependent variable (DV)** or **outcome variable** which is their total 'desire to eliminate people' score 

- Once we have all our data, we could then compare the results between the ice cream **condition** and the no ice cream **condition** to see which group gave higher ratings for their 'desire to eliminate people' score (the **outcome**/**DV**)

- Overall, this is an example of a very unethical and a poorly designed study

- With a well designed experiment, we can be confident in saying that our **manipulation** caused the change in our **outcome variable**/**dependent variable** (**DV**)

- But this isn't the case for our ice cream study for many reasons...

---

## Controls

- Our imaginary study didn't use *any* **controls**

- We recruited all kinds of people with no thought of how different characteristics might affect our results: 
  + We could have children as well as adults in our **sample**
  + We didn't screen for any health conditions that may affect our findings (allergies, intolerance, dietary requirements)

- We also didn't give any **standardised instructions**: some participants could have arrived very hungry, and others very full

- We didn't control our **IV** appropriately: we often changed the brand, the flavour of ice cream, &amp; 
the amount given - one day we ran out so had to use frozen yoghurt...
  - Now we don't know exactly what caused any changes in our **outcome**
  - The poor control of our **IV** creates **noise** in our data
  - It could be that only strawberry mini milks cause murderous tendencies

- We didn't control the lab environment it was conducted in, on some days the heating was up super high &amp; on others we had the windows wide open

---

## Randomisation

- We didn't **randomly assign** people to groups: maybe all our participants in the ice cream condition just so happened to have sensitive teeth, or already high levels of psychopathy 
  + This would affect the results and may give us the impression that ice cream increases murderous tendencies when it doesn't

- Differences between participants can introduce unwanted **variability** into the experiment

- To deal with this, participants should be sorted into the groups **randomly**

- A well-designed experiment randomises both **participant allocation** and **stimulus presentation order** (in our experiment, this refers to the images of faces our participants rated)

---

## Blinding

- In our study, we told them that we were interested in the effects of ice cream on murderous tendencies, &amp; we also gave them the ice cream ourselves

- Participants may (consciously or not) modify their behaviour in accordance with or contrary to the hypothesis

- Because of that, it is crucial that they be kept unaware of what the hypothesis is &amp; also what conditions they have been allocated to

- If participants are naÃ¯ve to group allocation, the study is said to be **single-blind**

- If neither the participants nor the researcher know which condition the participants are put in, the study design is known as **double-blind**
  + Allocation is recorded but only revealed once the study is over and the data are being analysed

---

## Theoretical Framework

- It's the researcher's job to decide which variable is the **predictor** (**IV**) and which is the **outcome** (**DV**) based on **theory**

- In this experiment, the decision to have ice cream as the **IV** &amp; murderous tendencies as the **DV** was not based on any **theoretical model**

  + It could be that committing murder causes people to eat ice cream, they could be completely unrelated &amp; the relationship between them is just a coincidence, or maybe something else is linked to them both...

---

## Experimental Design

- The experimental setting with its tight controls is always at least somewhat **artificial**
  + It presents an abstraction from reality

- Just because something is true in the lab, doesn't necessarily mean it will be true in "the real world"

- The experimental design provides the most rigorous methodology to investigate **causal relationships**

- However, there are often methodological, logistical, and ethical obstacles to randomisation, manipulation, and controls that render designing an experiment infeasible
  + This is when we might use **quasi-experiments** &amp; **natural experiments**

---

## Quasi-Experiment

- Conforms to all the requirements of the experimental design **except for participant randomisation**

- Used in situations where it is not possible to randomise the allocation of participants into group
  + E.g., the effectiveness of attending summer school - one school offers the intervention, the other does not
  
- But conditions should be **matched**
  + Participants are matched so that the groups don't differ on any relevant characteristics, other that the one being investigated


---

## Natural Experiment

- Manipulation and randomisation occur through some **natural** or **socio-political** means

- A good example are **twin studies**:
  + Identical twins share essentially 100% of their genes
  + Fraternal twins share on average 50% of their genes
  + Both kinds of twins tend to share the same home environment (raised together)
  + Comparing similarities between identical twins and similarities between fraternal twins, we can estimate the role of genes and environment in all sorts of things (physical/mental health, personality, cognitive ability, etc.) 

- Other kinds of natural experiments may be made possible due to policy changes (smoking ban, length of compulsory education...) or natural events

- Neither **natural experiments**, nor **quasi-experiments** are true experiments - they can't provide evidence of causality of the same strength as experiments



---

## Within- &amp; Between-Subjects

- Studies can also vary on whether the manipulation or measurement of interest occurs **between groups** of participants or **within** each participant's data

- **Between-subjects** also known as **independent designs** are where we compare different groups of participants 
  + This is where different participants are assigned to (or naturally fall into) different conditions
  
- **Within-subjects** also known as **repeated measures** designs are where we take the same measurement from the an individual multiple times
  + This is where the same participants are assigned to (or naturally fall into) *all* conditions of the study
  + Cons include **order effects** such as fatigue, practice etc.,

- **Mixed designs** have both within- and between-subjects components


---

## Time Frame

- The type of design we have can also vary on the time frame used

- **Cross-sectional designs**
  + Take a cross-section of a sample at a single time point
  + Cross-sectional studies are logistically easier to run compared to other types of studies
  + Not very useful for telling us how things change over time because different groups of participants are compared at the same time

- **Longitudinal designs**
  + Involves repeated measurement of the same characteristic of the same participants at multiple different time points
  + Logistically very difficult to do, some longitudinal studies have been going for several decades, &amp; are very expensive to run
    + They are very time-consuming for the researcher &amp; the participant, &amp; so the amount of missing data can be very high


---

## Missing Data

- Missing data can occur in all types of study - not just longitudinal studies though the large-scale of them makes it more likely

- Missing values can result from different causes: 
  + Tech issues meaning that an answer doesn't get registered or recorded
  + Participants skip a question or a task by accident
  + Participants don't wish to disclose a piece of information (more common with sensitive topics)

- Missing data are often assigned the value **NA**, for "**N**ot **A**pplicable"

- The presence and pattern of missing data can be random, but sometimes it isn't
  + Maybe the participants skipping your over income question are from a low SES background

- So by exploring the pattern and possible causes of missing responses we can learn more about our data



---

## Measurement

- Measurement refers to the way we **record behaviours, feelings, attitudes, &amp; characteristics in a quantifiable sense**

- We typically refer to these different measures as '**variables**'
  + **A variable is anything that can be measured which differs across participants or across time**

- Even things that we have not measured or manipulated can be variables: 
  + **Confounding** &amp; **extraneous variables** are variables that might affect the results of our study

- We can measure variables like height &amp; weight, but we can also measure 'unquantifiable' constructs like 'happiness' or 'lecture-induced boredom' 

---

## Measurement Issues

- With measurement there are some issues to be aware of:

  + In quantitative research we can use numerical values to represent pretty much any construct, but what we can do with our data depends on how we measured these 'things'

  + We must carefully consider any variables that might affect the interpretation of our findings (i.e., **confounding** &amp; **extraneous variables**), and ideally, we should design our study to eliminate or reduce their impact
  
  + We also have to consider how appropriate or *good* our measures are


---

## Measures as Tools

- All measurement involves the use of a tool or a **measure**

  + Tape measure

  + Stopwatch

  + Questionnaire

  + Exam

  + Experimental task

- These measures/tools must work in the way we expect them to (**validity**) and they must work the same each time (**reliability**)


---

## Construct Validity

- A measure is **valid** if it measures what it is supposed to measure

- In psychology, we often want to measure things that may be difficult to observe directly or **quantify** 

  + Things like happiness, cognitive ability, personality...

- We attempt to measure these unobservable things by using a range of different tools including questionnaires, experimental tasks, tests etc.

- We design these tools by using the theoretical underpinnings behind the constructs we are trying to measure

- **Construct validity** is the extent to which a tool can be justifiably trusted to actually measure the construct it is supposed to measure

---

## External Validity

- A study has **external validity** if its findings can be applied to the entire population of people with relevant characteristics &amp; in real-world conditions

  + If study uses a sample of white women in western cultures, the findings may only be true for white women in western cultures 

  + They may not apply or **generalise** to *all* people

- The amount to which findings apply in the real world outside of the study is **ecological validity**, this is often an issue for experiments

  + Just because something is true in the lab doesn't mean it is going to be true in the real world


---

## Reliability

- **Reliability** refers to the **consistency** of a measure

- A measure is considered to be reliable if it produces consistent results each time it's used by the same participant 

- For example, we could measure someone's maths anxiety with a questionnaire

- Our questionnaire could be considered reliable if we tested the same participant on different occasions and they got similar scores each time

- This stability over time is known as **test-retest reliability**
  + Doesn't work for measures that we expect to change over time


---

## Levels of Measurement

- The level of measurement refers to the kind of information we are working with when measuring attributes of interest

- There are four levels:

  + **Nominal**/**categorical**

  + **Ordinal**

  + **Interval**

  + **Ratio**

- Sometimes a construct can fall into many of these levels, and it's on the researcher to decide what measurement level is the most appropriate to use

---

## Nominal/categorical

- Refers to **names**, **categories**, **labels** or **group membership**

- Examples include:

  + Eye colour (e.g., green, brown, blue)
  + Occupation status (e.g., FT employed, PT employed, unemployed, student...)
  + Study condition (control, experimental)
  + Marital status
  + Even age can be nominal if we wanted it to be (under 50s vs over 50s)

- When using nominal variables, we cannot compare the different groups in any quantifiable way
  
  + It makes no sense to say that green is more than blue when it comes to eye colour

---

## Ordinal

- At the ordinal level, individual observations of the measured attribute can be **ordered** in a meaningful way

  + This could be marathon runners ranked in order of who came 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;...

- However, it doesn't provide any information about the differences between individual points
  
  + We don't know how much faster the winner was compared to the runner-up
  + The distance between the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; doesn't have to be the same as the distance between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, or between any adjacent pair of runners

- An example of this type of measure in psychology is the **Likert scale**:

.center[

&lt;img src="./LS.png" width="75%" /&gt;

]

- These scales are classed as **ordinal** because we can't say that the difference in agreement between "Agree" and "Neither agree nor disagree" is the same as the difference between "Disagree" and "Strongly disagree"

---

## Interval

- At the **interval** level of measurement, the differences (intervals) between pairs of adjacent values are the same

  + The difference in temperature between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius is the same as that between 35Â°C and 36Â°C

  + The intervals marked by the degrees are evenly spaced or equidistant

- But there is not an absolute zero point so we cannot say that 40Â°C is twice as hot as 20Â°C

- In psychology, a good example is IQ: 

  + Someone with an IQ of 200 is not twice as smart as someone with an IQ of 100

  + There's also no such thing as an IQ of zero


---

## Ratio

- Similar to interval, but with **ratio** data there is a **meaningful 0 point**

- Examples of the ratio level of measurement in psychology:

  + Reaction time

  + Number of correct responses

  + Score on an exam

  + Income


---

## Variable/Data Types 

- When using quantitative methods, we represent variables with a numerical value, but we can have different types depending on the type of data it represents

- **Continuous variables** can contain any numerical value within a certain range
  + e.g., time, height, weight

- **Discrete variables** can only contain some values

  + e.g., number of children: hypothetically you can have any number of children, but it has to be a **whole number**
  + There's no such thing as a 2.4 children

- **Binary variables** can only take one of two possible values
  + A special case of **discrete variables**
  + Used for variables with two responses/categories: yes &amp; no, heads Vs tails, pass/fail...
