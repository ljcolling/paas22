## The "how" of quantitative research

The **conclusions** that we can draw from research depends on **how** the
knowledge was generated

For any piece of research we plan (or any research we read), we must be able to
answer:

1. How do we actually test **hypotheses** appropriately?

2. How do we **generalise** our findings?

3. How do we **quantify** seemingly unquantifiable things? 

The answer to these questions lies in **research design**

---

## The "how" of quantitative research

**Research designs** can vary on lots of different dimensions:

1. Some designs have some kind of **manipulation** and others don't

2. Some designs involve **multiple measurements from the same people** and some
design **compare groups**

3. Some designs take all their measurement **at one point in time** and others
**follow participants across time**

The design we choose depends on:

- Our hypothesis
- The resources we have (time, money, facilities)
- Logistical considerations
- Ethical considerations

## An example: Ice cream and murder

We might decide to conduct some research into this relationship between ice
cream and murder to see whether there's actually a **causal**
relationship^[For now, we'll just **ignore** all the **ethical issues**]

\

<center>How would we actually go about this?</center>

\

1. We start with a **research question**

This is the **question** we hope our **research** will **answer**

We might have something like the following:

> Does eating ice cream make you more prone to murderous tendencies?

---

## An example: Ice cream and murder

2. Next we come up with a **hypothesis**

In our **hypothesis**  we specify the outcome we expect

We might have something like the following:

> Eating ice cream increases the desire to commit murder


To test this **hypothesis** we'll design an experiment...

---

### Testing our hypothesis

Our experiment might be something like the following:

1. Invite a group of people into the lab

2. Give half the people some ice cream to eat, and don't give any ice cream to
the other half (our **manipulation**)

3. We then get all participants to look at pictures of people (the **stimuli**)
and rate how much they want to **eliminate** them on a scale from 0 (no desire) to 9
(all the desire possible)

After the experiment we might thank the participants, and *debrief* them by
describing the aims of the study in more depth...

---

### Testing our hypothesis

In our study we're **manipulating** one thing and we're **measuring** one thing

This means our study has one **independent variable (IV)** and one **dependent
variable (DV)**

You'll encounter the terms **independent variable (IV)** and **dependent
variable (DV)** a lot, so let's define what they mean:

- The **dependent** variable is the variable that you analyse. Its value _depends_
on the value of other variables. It's the thing we're measuring, and it's
sometimes also called the _outcome_.

  - In our example, this is _desire to eliminate_


- An **independent variable** is a variable that *influences the values* of your
**dependent variable**. It's the thing we're manipulating, and it's sometimes
also called the _predictor_.

  - In our example, this is _whether or not somebody was given ice cream_

---

## Features of good study design

In a well designed experiment, we can be confident in saying our
**manipulation** _caused_ a change in our **outcome**

But this isn't the case with **our** study, because we're **missing** a lot of
things (or at least we haven't specified them yet). Including:

- Controls

- Randomisation

- Blinding

- A theoretical framework

---

### Controls


Our imaginary study didn't use _any_ **controls** (we touched on _controls_ last
week too)

- We recruited all kinds of people without giving consideration to how different
characteristics might affect our results:

  - We might have children as well as adults in our _sample_

  - We might have people with lactose intolerance in our _sample_ who would've
    experienced discomfort eating ice-cream

- We didn't have _standardised instructions_ for participants who enrolled in
  the study

  - Maybe some participants arrived very hungry, and others arrived very full,
    and the hungry participants were just _hangry_

---

### Controls

- We didn't control our **IV** appropriately: We might have often changed the
  brand, the flavour, or the amount of ice-cream. Maybe one day we gave frozen
  yoghurt instead of ice cream

  - Now we don't know exactly what caused any changes in our **outcome**

  - It could be that only strawberry mini milks cause murderous tendencies


- We didn't control the lab environment it was conducted in. On some days the
  heating was up super high and on others we had the windows wide open

  - Maybe people only felt murderous when they were made to eat ice-cream in the
    cold


---

### Randomisation

Another feature that might have been missing from our study is **randomisation**

- We didn't **randomly assign** people to the groups

  - Maybe we recruited all our participants for the _ice cream_ condition first,
    and we did this outside of a dentists office

  - It might be that most of these participants had sensitive teeth and so
    eating cold food made them angry

- A well-designed experiment should **randomise** both participant allocation
  and **stimulus presentation order** (which we touched on last week in the
  _memory example_)

---

### Blinding

Another feature that might have been missing from our study is **blinding**

- Maybe we told participants that we were interested in the effects of ice cream
  on murderous tendencies

  - Participants may have (consciously or not) modified their behaviour to fit
    or contradict our hypothesis

- Maybe we also gave all the participants the ice cream ourselves

  - If participants are na√Øve to group allocation then the study is said to be
    **single-blind**

- If neither the participants nor the researcher know which condition the
  participants are put in, the study design is known as **double-blind**

  - Allocation is recorded but only revealed once the study is over and the data
    are being analysed

---

### Theoretical Framework

- The choice of **predictor** (**IV**) and **outcome** (**DV**) variables does not
happen in a theoretical vacuum

- These choices **should** be base on theory, but in our experiment these
  choices weren't based on theory

- It could be that murder **causes** people to eat ice-cream, in which case we
  should probably swap the **IV** and **DV**

- Or it might be that they're completely unrelated and any effect we find is
  just a **coincidence**

---

## Types of experimental studies

We've already talked a bit about **experimental designs**, but experiments
actually come in different types

- **True** experiments

- Quasi-experiments

- And natural experiments

Sometimes it's not logistically, or ethically, possible to do a **true**
experiment, so that's where **quasi-experiments** and **natural experiments**
come in handy

---

### (True) Experiments

- True experiments usually have **tight controls**

- They can be somewhat artificial because they _abstract away
  from the real world_

- This means they lack something called **ecological validity**

- Ecological validity refers to the ability to generalise the results _from an
  experiment_ **to** _the real world_

  - Just because something is true in the lab, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be
    true in the _real world_

- But experiments provide the most rigorous methodology for investigating
  **causal relationships**.

Experiments can be difficult to perform from a **logistical** point of view,
because **randomisation** can be difficult, and sometimes **manipulating** IVs
directly can be difficult or impossible

---

### Quasi-experiments

- **Quasi-experiments** are similar to **true experiments** except for
  participant randomisation 

- This makes them useful in situations were randomisation isn't possible 

  - E.g., the effectiveness of attending summer school - one school offers the
    intervention and the other does not

- In situations like this, we should still try to **match** the participants so
  that the groups don't differ on any relevant characteristics, except for
  the ones we're investigating

---

### Natural experiment

- **Natural experiments** are studies where **randomisation** and
  **manipulation** occur through **natural** or **socio-political** processes

- One example might be **twin studies**

  - Identical twins share essentially 100% of their genes

  - Fraternal twins share on average 50% of their genes

  - Both kinds of twins tend to share the same home environment (raised
    together)

  - Comparing similarities between identical twins and similarities between
    fraternal twins, we can estimate the role of genes and environment in all
    sorts of things (physical/mental health, personality, cognitive ability,
    etc.)


- Other kinds of natural experiments might be a result of policy changes (like
  _smoking bans_, or _changes in the length of compulsory eduction_) or natural
  events

[Aspects of study design]{.section}


---

### Within-subject and between-subjects designs

Studies can vary on whether the **manipulation** or **measurements** occurs
**between groups**

- In **between-subjects** or **independent** designs we compare different
  **groups** of participants 

  - Different participants are assigned to (or naturally fall into) different
    conditions

- In **within-subjects** or **repeated measures** we take _repeated
  measurements_ from participants

  - This is where each participant gets assigned to _all the conditions_ and we
    compare, e.g., how a person responded differently in the different
    conditions

- **Mixed designs** have both **within-subject** and **between-subject**
  manipulations

  - For example, we might split people into two groups, but then still measure
    each person under multiple conditions

_Within-subject_ designs have some disadvantages like order effects (people
might perform differently in the second condition because they get better at the
task, or worse because they get tired)

But with _within-subject_ designs it can sometimes be easier to detect
differences between conditions

---

### Time frame

Studies can also vary in terms of whether participants are measured at one
points in time or whether they're followed over time

**Cross-sectional designs**

- Take a _cross-section_ of the sample at a **single point in time**

- Logistically easier than other types of studies

- Not very useful for telling us how things change over time

---

### Time frame

**Longitudinal designs**

- Involves repeated measurements of the same characteristics from the same
  participants at multiple different points in time

- Logistically very difficult to do and can be expensive. Some can run for years
  or even decades

- Very useful for seeing how things change over time. Particularly useful for
  studying e.g., developmental processes

- Because they can run for so long there can be issues with missing data

  - Missing data can be complex to deal with because sometimes data is missing
    at random, but other times it can be tracking something you're interested in

  - E.g., A study on whether dating apps help you find love might show that no
    people find love on the apps, but that might just be because those that do
    find love drop out of the study

---

## Issues in measurement

Whenever we're trying to measure something there are some issues that we need to
be aware of^[We touched on these last week, but we'll talk about them in more
detail here]
\

### Construct validity

- In psychology we measure lots of things that are difficult to _observe
  directly_

  - This includes things like _happiness_, _cognitive ability_, and aspects of
    _personality_

- We try to measure these things using a range of tools including
  _questionnaires_, and _experimental tasks_

- We design these tools using the _theoretical underpinnings_ behind the
  **constructs** we're trying to measure

- **Construct validity** is the extent to which a tool can be justifiably
  trusted to actually measure the construct it is supposed to measure.

---

### External validity

- We want to be able to **generalise** the findings from our studies beyond the
  particular people that took part in our study

- And we want to be able to **generalise** the findings from our studies beyond
  the _exact experimental tasks and setup_ used in our study

- A study has **external validity** if it can be generalised to the _population_
  of people with relevant characteristics

  - It might be the case that if our study only used white mean in western
    cultures that the findings might only **generalise** to white men in western
    cultures

- **Ecological validity** is a type of external validity that is particularly
  relevant to **experimental designs**

  - Refers to whether the findings of a study apply to the "_real world_"

---

#### WEIRD samples

- Researchers have questioned whether the results from typical psych
  studies are generalisable

- Most psychology studies are conducted in a small handful of countries in the 
  Global North (e.g., in North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand)

- Many of these studies also make use of _undergraduate psychology students_ for 
  their participants

- More generally, typical psychology studies are conducted in societies that are 
WEIRD:
  
    - Western
    - Educated
    - Industrialised 
    - Rich
    - Democratic

Understanding exactly whether and how these impact the **generalisability** of 
psychology findings means running more studies with samples that aren't WEIRD


---

### Reliability

- Reliability is about the **consistency** of a measure

- A measure is **reliable** if it produces the same results each time it's used
  on the same participant

- E.g., If we're measuring maths anxiety with a questionnaire then our
  questionnaire is **reliable** if we get similar scores each time we test a
  particular participant

- This kind of _stability over time_ is known as **test-retest reliability**

---

## Levels of measurement 

The last couple of things we'll cover in this lecture will be about the 
**jargon** we use to talk about the _nature of the measurements_ we're taking

- The first set of terms describe the **kind of information** we're working
with

- We call this the **level of measurement**

- There are **four** levels of measurement

    1. Nominal/categorical

    2. Ordinal

    3. Interval

    4. Ratio


Sometimes a construct can fall into many of these levels, and it's on the
researcher to decide what measurement level is the most appropriate to use.

---

## Levels of measurement 

### Nominal/categorical

Refers to **names**, **categories**, **labels**, or **group membership**.

- Some examples include:
  - Eye colour (e.g., green, brown, blue)
  - Occupation status (e.g., FT employed, PT employed, unemployed, student...)
  - Study condition (control, experimental);
  - Even age can be nominal if we wanted it to be (under 50s vs over 50s).

- Can't compare the different groups in any quantifiable way

  - E.g., It doesn't make sense to say that green is more blue when it comes to
    eye colour.

---

### Ordinal level

Individual observations can be **ordered** in a meaningful way

For example:

- We could order marathon runners ranked in order of who came 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

- However, doesn't give information about the differences between individual points

  - E.g., We don't know how much faster the winner is compared to the runner-up

  - The distance between 1st and 2nd doesn't have to be the same as the distance
between 2nd and 3rd

- Common in psychology because of **Likert scale**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "500px"
#| fig.align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","LS.png"))
```

---

### Interval level

- At the **interval** level of measurement, the differences (intervals) between
  pairs of adjacent values are the same

  - E.g., The difference between 20¬∞C and 21¬∞C is the same as between 35¬∞C and
    36¬∞C.

- But there is no **absolute zero point**

  - E.g., IQ is measured at the interval level. Somebody with an IQ of 200 isn't twice as smart as
    somebody with an IQ of 100, because there is no such thing as an IQ of 0

### Ratio level

- The **ratio level** is similar to the interval level, but there is a **meaningful 0 point**.

- Some examples of the ratio level of measurement that you might encounter in
  psychology are:
  - Reaction time
  - Number of correct responses
  - Score on an exam

---

## Variable / data types

When we represent variables with numbers we can have different types depending on
the type of data

**Continuous variables** can contain any numerical value within a certain range

  - E.g., time, height, and weight

**Discrete variables** can only contain some values

- E.g., The number of children (only whole numbers, because there's not such thing as 2.5 children)

**Binary variables** can only take one of two possible values (Special case of **discrete variables** )

- E.g., Head / Tails, Pass / Fail

Our **IV**s and **DV**s can be any type (continuous, discrete, binary) or any level
of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio). It all depends on the study!
