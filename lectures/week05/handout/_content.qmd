Today's lecture comes in two parts. In the first part of the lecture, we'll
discuss a few contemporary issues in psychological research, specifically
around what's known as the replication crisis and the **open science** movement
that has emerged to address some of the shortcomings of how science is done.
Some of the practices in the **open science** movement, particularly something
known as **pre-registration** are the inspiration for the **lab report** that
you'll complete this term.

While the first part of the lecture will tell you about the motivation behind
the lab report, the second part will cover some of the practicalities.
Specifically, it will cover some of the details of exactly what is expected
from you.

This style of lab report will probably be new for all of you. So if it looks like
something you've never done before then don't worry. You're all in the same boat.

## Some terminology

We'll be using the terms **replicability** and **reproducibility** in this
lecture. There isn't a _universal agreement_ on what these two terms mean, and
sometimes people use them as **synonyms**. This is probably because both terms
refer to cases where researchers **try to obtain the same results** as earlier
researchers. To avoid any confusion, I'll explain the usage that I think is
most common in the literature and the way I'll be using them in this lecture.

**Reproducibility** refers to getting the same results by using the **same
(statistical) methods** on the **same dataset**. A study is reproducible if you
can take the original data from an earlier study by different researchers and
**reproduce** the numbers/statistics reported in the original journal article.

This might sound like it's trivial, but it turns out that it isn't! One of the
reasons you're learning `R` and `Quarto` in this course is so that you can
learn how to do **reproducible** science.

**Replicability** refers to getting the same results by using the **same
methods** on a **new dataset** that you collect. A study is replicable if you
can repeat the study using the same methods (e.g., experimental design,
analysis) to produce a new dataset that produces the same conclusions as the
original study.

## The replication crisis

Several large-scale studies in the early part of the last decade [see @open2;
@open1] attempted to replicate some classic findings in the psychology
literature. That is, researchers tried to run the studies again to see if they
could produce the same results and conclusions as the original studies. This
turned out to be spectacularly **unsuccessful**. Some estimates suggest that
possibly 50% or more of these classic findings (the kind of findings that
support the theories you read about in your textbooks) could not be replicated.
This has prompted some to claim that psychology is in a state of **crisis**.

Identifying that the crisis exists, however, is only the first step. Several
researchers have tried to understand the causes of this crisis. It's probably
the case that there isn't a single cause of the replication crisis. Rather,
there are likely **several** related causes that might be to blame. 

These causes might include how **statistics** and **statistical procedures**
are used and abused in psychology. Incentives in the publishing and university
system that might favour _flashy findings_ above _methodological rigour_. And
the lack of clearly defined theories in psychological science. That is,
theories that make unambiguous predictions about what should happen in
experiments (see Lecture 2).

When we designed the psychology methods courses at Sussex, many of these issues
were at the forefront of our minds. I won't be able to go into all of these
possible causes in detail in this lecture, so instead, I'll try and pull out
some of the issues that were most relevant to our thinking about the lab
report.

## Bias in Publishing

If we look specifically at the published literature in psychology we'll notice
something odd. The **vast majority** of published papers in psychology journals
report findings that **support** the *tested hypotheses* (see @fig-bad).

#|  than researchers in other fields. [image from @muchpos]


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "much_positive.png"))
```

But how is this possible? It could be psychology researchers as psychic, and
they only test hypotheses that turn out to be true. Or it could be that the
hypotheses they test are _trivial_. But remember in Lecture 2, I said that
theories in psychology often make probabilistic claims, so even if they are
true then we might not expect **every** experiment that tests a specific theory
to show evidence for that theory. Rather, it seems plausible that there may
be some sort of **bias** in the kinds of papers that get published.

One source of **bias in the publishing** of psychology studies that people have
argued exists is that **journal editors** and **peer reviewers** might not want
to publish studies when they don't like the results. They might not like the
results for a variety of reasons, but one, in particular, might be that if
studies don't show support for the tested hypothesis then reviewers might believe
that the results are **less reliable**. And this belief might be particularly
strong in cases where new studies fail to find support for **famous** or
**influential** theories.

If a new study **doesn't find support** for a _famous or influential theory_
then editors/reviewers might be _more likely_ to suspect there's _some kind of
problem with the new study_, and they might choose not to publish it.

Bias might also happen at the level of the researcher in deciding what to submit
for publication in the first place. For example, if a researcher fails to find
support for the theory they've tested then they might not even try to have it 
published at all.


## Bias in statistical procedures

In addition to bias in publishing, there are also certain practices that
researchers can engage in that can invalidate the results of their studies.
These practices are collectively known as questionable research practices or
QPRs. One group of QPRs, known as **p-hacking** can make it so that researchers
are more likely to find statistical results that support the tested hypothesis
even if the tested hypothesis is not true. Some of these practices are very
subtle and may occur without researchers deliberately trying to engage in any
form of malpractice. One such practice can occur when researchers repeatedly run
their statistical tests after adding more and more participants to their sample. 

We'll learn more about the theory that explains the problems with this practice
in later lectures, but for now, it will probably be easier to explain by way of
an example. Let's say you have a theory that says that people from West Sussex
are taller than people from East Sussex. But let's also say that theory isn't
true. However, you decide to test it by measuring a random group of 10 people
from West Sussex and a random group of 10 people from East Sussex. The heights of
these people won't be exactly the same, so you might find that the East Sussex
people are slightly taller. If you added another random group of 20 people, 
the heights of these people will again not be identical. As a result, you might 
find that the West Sussex people are now slightly taller. But you might equally
find the opposite. 

Whether you find that West Sussex people are taller or East Sussex people are
taller is just due to random variation in your sample. That is, because of this
random variation, even though West Sussex people aren't taller, you'll
**sometimes** find that they are. And you'll **sometimes** find that people
from East Sussex are taller. If you decide to continue adding more people to
your study and checking the results after each batch of people, then you can
just decide to stop your study whenever your results happen to show what you
want. And it can be easy for you, as a researcher, to justify this to yourself
by simply saying that before the point where you decided to stop, you simply
hadn't measured enough people for your sample to be representative.

But if there is bias in what studies get published, and if it can be easy for 
researchers to engage in practices that invalidate their statistical procedures,
then what is the solution? One proposed solution is *pre-registration*.

### Pre-registration in the media

The idea of pre-registration has been covered in popular media. For example, it's
been written about in *The Guardian* on several occasions. Some examples include:

- [_Trust in science would be improved by study pre-registration_](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/jun/05/trust-in-science-study-pre-registration)

- [_Psychology’s ‘registration revolution’_](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/20/psychology-registration-revolution)

- [_Psychology uses 'registered replication reports' to improve reliability_](https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2013/may/15/psychology-registered-replication-reports-reliability)

- [_The psychology behind a nice cup of tea_](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/27/the-psychology-behind-a-nice-cup-of-tea)

## Pre-registration and combating bias

**Preregistration** means that **before** conducting a study, researchers plan
their study in detail. This involves specifying the theory they plan to test
and specifying all their hypotheses. They also specify details such as the
number of participants they intend to sample, and the statistical procedures
that they intend to use. Additionally, this plan is made publicly accessible in
some way so that there is a record of what the researcher intended to do.

By doing this, preregistration might improve the reliability of published
research by combating certain kinds of **researcher bias**, such as the example
of *p-hacking* outlined above. Additionally, because the hypotheses are
specified before the data are collected, this also means that researchers can't
**change their hypotheses** to make them fit whatever their data happened to
show (think about _falsification_ and infinitely flexible theories from Lecture
2). All this helps to ensure that the results of studies are more reliable.
	
Preregistration can also help combat bias at the publishing stage.
Because researchers outline their plans in detail, peer reviewers and journal
editors can judge whether the methods are scientifically rigorous and whether
the study is likely to produce reliable results. And, importantly, they can
make these decisions before seeing the results of a study.

In a special form of preregistration, known as a **registered report**, editors
and reviewers can accept studies for publication **before the data are
collected**. This can happen because the detailed research plans allow editors
and reviewers to judge whether the study will be scientifically sound before
the results are known. And they can make these decisions without being
influenced by the actual results.


## Registered reports in action

To see an example of a registered report in action, we'll take a look at a
study by @collingfischer. Our story starts with a paper published by @fischer.
In this, they reported a study that claimed to show that _merely looking at
numbers_ would cause a _shift in attention_ to either the left or the right
side of space depending on whether the number was big (6-10) or small (1-4).

The exact details of the study and the theories that the data was used to
support aren't vitally important for our purposes. The key point, however, was
that this finding was **very influential**, with more than 700 subsequent
studies citing this finding or building on this work. Because this finding was
influential, it's not surprising that some researchers tried to replicate it.
That is, they tried to run a study using the same methods as the original
experiment to see if they could get the same results. Most of these studies
were **successful**---that is, they found results that were broadly in
agreement with what @fischer had shown. A few **published** studies failed to
replicate it, but these were in the minority.

But is the finding true? Does merely looking at numbers cause you to
shift your attention to the left or the right? If you looked just at the
**published studies** you would certainly have reason to believe that it is
true. But if you spoke to people at scientific conferences then many researchers
would tell you that they **couldn't** successfully replicate it. This just
wasn't reflected in the **scientific literature**. But how did it come to be
like this?

Knowing exactly how it came to be like this is difficult (probably impossible)
to know. But possible reasons might be that the original finding was
published in an **extremely prestigious journal** (Nature Neuroscience), and
that it quickly became a very influential finding. This means that it probably
got accepted as something like an **established fact**.

Once a finding is accepted as something like an **established fact** then
journal editors and reviewers might be reluctant to publish studies that don't
support the original finding. This is not totally surprising. If something is an
established fact, and a new study comes along trying to overturn it then what is
more likely? That the established fact is wrong? Or that there's something wrong
with the new study?

For example, let's say that I ran a study that showed that gravity didn't exist. 
What is more likely, that gravity doesn't exist or that there is a problem with 
my study. It's reasonable to conclude that there is a problem with my study. But
with other theories, it might be the case that the established theory is wrong. 
The best way to decide this is to try to judge the study on its 
methods rather than being influenced by what the study found.
A **registered report** makes this possible.

With a **registered report**, you actually **submit** your **research plan** to 
a journal before you run the study. The journal **reviews the plan** and agrees 
to publish the study when it's done, provided that you do the study exactly how 
you said you would.

Knowing whether the findings by @fischer were true or not was something I was
curious about. As mentioned, there was this disconnect between what people said
at conferences and what you could read in journals. So I decided to put together
a **registered report** where I would attempt to **replicate** the study by
@fischer (I also added in a few extra tasks, so that if I could replicate it
then I would also be able to get a better idea of the exact mechanisms that are
responsible for the effect).

The plan that I put together contained a lot of detail. It specified exactly
who would be recruited to take part as participants. It specified exactly how
the data would be collected, and it described all the tasks in detail. It also
described all the statistical analyses that would be performed on the data, and
what conclusions I would draw based on the results of these analyses. 

After planning the study in detail, I then approached a journal **with this
plan** to see if they were willing to publish the study if I did it according to
the plan. The plan went out to reviewers to check (including people involved with
the original study), and once everyone was happy the journal agreed that they
would publish it.

I then gathered together 30+ psychological scientists from 17 different universities
around the world, and we ran the experiment on over 1300 participants. This
sample size was nearly 100 times bigger than the original study. So what did we
find?

We found **absolutely no evidence** for the original finding. We found **no
evidence** that the **additional manipulations** that we included, manipulations
that people thought might _modulate the size of the effect_, modulated the size
of the effect. 

This finding is now no longer accepted as true. But a lot of resources might
have been wasted studying this non-existent effect. Think of all the people that
tried to replicate it, but failed, and then couldn't get their studies
published. This finding is by no means a unique case. There are likely to be many
**zombie findings** in psychology, and that is why things like **registered
reports** are so important. The concept of the **registered report** is the
inspiration for the lab report that you'll be doing this year.

## The reproducibility crisis

This lecture is primarily about the replication crisis and registered reports.
But it's also worth (very briefly) touching on reproducibility because
reproducibility is the inspiration for why you're learning about `R` and
`R Studio` in the practical classes.

Replication is the idea that we should be able to run a study again and find
the same results. Reproducibility is the idea that we should be able to take a
dataset that was collected for a study, run the analysis described in the
journal article, and re-produce the same numbers that we see in the published
paper.

This might seem like it's something that should be easy to do. If you have the
data from the original study, you should just be able to run the analysis that
is described in the journal article. And if you do this, then you **should**
get the same numbers.

My colleagues and I decided to test this out [see @cruwell]. Sharing data from
studies is relatively rare. More commonly, when researchers publish papers, only
the results of the analysis are reported in the article, and they don't share
the data they collected. However, sharing data has recently become more common.
For example, in one 2019 issue of the journal Psychological Science, all the
papers published in that issue shared their data so it was publicly
available. As a result, we decided to take all that data, and re-analyze it
according to the descriptions in the journal articles, to see whether we could
produce the same numbers.

What did we find? In short, we found that of the 14 papers, we could only
**exactly reproduce** the numbers in one of them. For an additional 3, we could
get very close to the numbers reported (there were only small differences that
didn't change any of the conclusions). For the remainder, however, we found it
impossible to reproduce the numbers. So what went wrong?

There were a few things that went wrong. First, some of the researchers did not
share the appropriate data. For example, some of the data they shared was
missing key parts. Or some of the data they shared wasn't adequately labeled.
However, a major issue, was that the analyses **were not adequately described**.
That is, the researchers didn't give enough detail in how they analyzed the data
for us to re-analyze it.

But why was this detail lacking? It's hard to know exactly why, but a likely
explanation is that it can be difficult to give verbal descriptions in
sufficient detail so that another researcher can follow them. But I did say that
we could exactly reproduce the numbers in one of the papers. So what did these
authors do differently?

They wrote the entire paper using `R` and `Quarto` just like you're learning
about in the practical classes. For this paper, we didn't need to sift through
the verbal descriptions describing what analysis they did, how they kept some
participants and rejected others, or what version of a particular statistical
test they performed. We just needed to re-run their code! And we could also
check their `R` code in detail to see **exactly** what they did, which would
allow us, if we wanted to, to also assess whether what they did was correct.

Making the code available helps to make sure the findings are **reproducible**.
It allows reviewers to check for errors in the analysis. And it helps us be
more certain of the soundness of the published literature. But sharing code
isn't common, because most psychology students, and psychological scientists,
aren't taught how to write code. But this is slowly changing. And we're
teaching you because we want you to be better than the generation that came
before you.

## Finding out more

The concepts and ideas that we learned about in this lecture are all part of the
open science (or, more broadly, the open scholarship) movement. Open science and
open scholarship are a big focus in the School of Psychology at Sussex. You can
